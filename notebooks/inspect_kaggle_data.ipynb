Text: Appeal No. 101 of 1959.\\nAppeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated November 8, 1957, of the Deputy Custodian General, Evacuee Property, Now Delhi Revision Petition No. 17 R/55 of 1955.\\nAchhru Ram and K. L. Mehta for the appellants.\\nB.K., Khanna and, T. M. Sen, for the respondent No. 1.\\nN.S. Bindra and A. G. Ratnaparkhi, for the respondents Nos.\\nMarch 15.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUDHOLKAR J.\\nThe appellants who are admittedly displaced persons from West Pakistan were granted quasi permanent allotment of 24 standard acres and 15 3/4 units in the village of Raikot in Ludhiana District in 1949.\\nTheir father Sardar Nand Singh who was 42 330 found entitled to quasi permanent allotment of 40 standard acres and 5 1/4 units of land was given quasipermanent allotment in another village named Humbran in the same district.\\nThe two villages are, however, 25 miles or so distant from each other.\\nNand Singh, therefore, made an application for consolidation of his lands with those of the appellants in the village Raikot.\\nDuring the pendency of this application he died and after his death, the, application was continued by the appellants.\\nThis application was rejected by the Assistant Custodian on July 23, 1951 on the ground that no land was available in the village Raikot.\\nA revision petition preferred by the appellants against the order of the Assistant Custodian was dismissed by the Additional Custodian on August 20, 1952.\\nOn October 7, 1952 the appellants preferred a revision application before the Custodian General.\\nDuring the pendency of the revision application the Additional Custodian for the State of Punjab cancelled the allotment of fourteen quasi permanent allottees of the village Karodian in the same district on the ground that these persons were entitled to allotment of suburban land a had been wrongly fitted in the village Karodian.\\nActing suo motu the Additional Custodian made an order on October 31, 1952 cancelling the order of allotment of land in the village Raikot made in favour of the appellants in the year 1949 and instead allotted to them land in Karodian in substitution of :,the lands at Raikot and of the lands allotted to their father.\\nThe land allotted was out of the land released upon the cancellation of allotment of lands in favour of the aforementioned 14 allottees.\\nThese fourteen allottees preferred an application for review of the order cancelling their allotment on the ground that this cancellation was a result of misapprehension of the actual facts and that they were not entitled to allotment of suburban lands at all.\\nThe appellants also preferred an application for review of the order cancelling their quasi permanent allotment in the village Raikot.\\nThe Additional Custodian for the State of Punjab recommended to the Custodian General the restoration 331 of the land to the 14 allottees which had been taken away from them by reason of cancellation of the allotment in their favour by the order dated October 31, 1952.\\nThe Additional Custodian admitted that these persons were not entitled to allotment of suburban land and that consequently their allotment had been wrongly made but referred the matter back to the Additional Custodian for decision.\\nThe application made by the appellants was kept pending till the decision of the application of the 14 allottees of Karodian.\\nThe Additional Custodian, however, dismissed the application on the ground that r. 14(6) of the Evacuee Property Rules which came into force on July 22, 1952, stood in the way of cancellation of the allotment in favour of the appellant.\\nOn December 17, 1954, the Deputy Custodian General, before whom these allottees had preferred an application for revision, revised the order of the Additional Custodian and restored to the 14 allottees of Karodian the land which had been originally allotted to them.\\nand allotment of which had been cancelled earlier.\\nAs a result of this order the allotment of Karodian land made in favour of the appellants automatically stood cancelled.\\nOn January 6, 1955, the appellants moved the Deputy Custodian General for calling up their review application and for revising the order of October 31, 1952 passed by the Additional Custodian cancelling the allotment of Raikot lands which had originally been made in their favour in the year 1949.\\nConsequent upon the cancellation of the appellants ' allotment of the Raikot land they were allotted to respondents 2 to 4.\\nThese persons were, therefore, impleaded as parties to the proceedings before the Deputy Custodian General.\\nBy the order dated November 8, 1957 the Deputy Custodian General dismissed the appellants ' application.\\nThe appellants have, therefore, come up to this Court by way of appeal with special leave.\\nThe ground on which the appellants ' application was rejected by the Deputy Custodian General was that his jurisdiction to revise the order has been 332 taken away by virtue of the provisions of , (44 of 1954) and the notification issued thereunder on March 24, 1955.\\nIn taking this view he has relied upon the decision in Bal Mukund vs The State of Punjab (1).\\nIn that case the Court has held that the powers of the Custodian General to deal with matters of this kind have been taken away by the , and that these powers now vest in another authority and that there is no provision for continuing the pro ceedings which had been commenced under the , but had not been concluded.\\nMr. Achhruram for the appellants challenged the correctness of this decision.\\nThere is no specific provision in this Act to the effect that after its commencement the jurisdiction of the various authorities created by the , to deal with the allotment or cancellation of allotment of evacuee property shall cease.\\nWhat is urged by Mr. Khanna on behalf of the Custodian General is that this is the effect of the provisions of sections 12(2) and 19 of the Act.\\nSection 12 of the 1954 Act empowers the Central Government to acquire evacuee property for rehabilitation of displaced persons by publishing in the official gazette a notification to the effect that it has decided to acquire such evacuee property in pursuance of this provision.\\nIt is common ground that by notification section R. 0. 697 dated March 24, 1955 the Central Government decided to acquire all evacuee property allotted to displaced persons by the Custodian under the \"Conditions\" contained in the notification of the Government of Punjab in the Department of Rehabilitation, No. 4892 6 dated July 8, 1949, except certain categories of property specified in the schedule.\\nThe Raikot lands were allotted to the appellants under the aforesaid notification of the Government of Punjab.\\nIt is not disputed on their behalf that they do not fall within any of the excepted categories of property, set out in the schedule.\\nSub section 2 of section 12 of the Act (1) I.L.R. 1957 Punj.\\n333 provides that on the publication of the notification under sub section 1 the right, title or interest of any evacuee in the property specified in the notification shall immediately stand extinguished and that property shall vest absolutely in the Central Government free from all encumbrances.\\nThe power of the Custodian under the , to allot any property to a person or to cancel an allotment existing in favour of a person rests on the fact that the property vests in him.\\nBut the consequence of the publication of the notification by the Central Government under section 12(1) of the with respect to any property or a class of property would be to divest the Custodian completely of his right in the property flowing from section 8 of the , and vest that property in the Central Government.\\nHe would, therefore, not be competent to deal with the property in any manner in the absence of any provision in either of these two enactments permitting him to do so.\\nNo provision was, however, pointed out to us in either of these Acts whereunder despite the Vesting of the property in the Central Government the Custodian was empowered to deal with it.\\nSub section\\n4 of section 12 of the 1954 Act provides that all evacuee property acquired under that section shall form part of the compensation pool.\\nUnder section 16(1) of this Act the Central Government is empowered to take such measures as it considers necessary or expedient for the custody, management and disposal of the compensation pool.\\nSub section\\n2 of section 16 empowers the Central Government to appoint such officers as it deems fit or to constitute such authority or corporation as it deems fit for the purpose of managing and disposing of the properties forming part of the compensation pool.\\nSection 19 of the Act provides that notwithstanding anything contained in any contract or any other law for the time being in force but subject to the rules that may be made under the Act the managing officer or managing corporation may cancel any allotment etc., under which any evacuee property acquired under the Act is held or 334 occupied by a person whether such allotment or lease was granted before or after the commencement of the Act.\\nThis provision thus confers the power to deal with evacuee property acquired under the Act only on a managing officer appointed or managing corporation constituted under the Act and makes no mention whatsoever of the Custodian appointed under the .\\nNo doubt, under section 10 of the the Custodian is empowered to manage evacuee property and in exercise of his power he will be competent to allot such property to any person or to cancel an allotment or lease made in favour of a person.\\nApart from the fact that subsequent to the issue of the notification under section 12(1) of the , the property would cease to be evacuee property, the aforesaid powers of the Custodian would be in conflict with those conferred by section 19 of the 1954 Act on a managing officer or a managing corporation constituted under that Act.\\nIn other words, to that extent the provisions of section 10 of the 1950 Act and section 19 of the 1954 Act cannot stand together.\\nAs already stated the powers conferred by sub section\\n(1) of section 19 of the 1954 Act are to prevail notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force.\\nTherefore, they must prevail over the provisions of B. 10 of the .\\nIt is true that there, is nothing on record to show that a managing officer was appointed with respect to the Raikot properties acquired under the notification dated March 24, 1955.\\nBut it is not necessary to ascertain that fact.\\nThe point is, who, after the coming into force of the 1954 Act could cancel an allotment.\\nSection 10 says that only a managing officer or a managing corporation can do so.\\nThis means that no one else can do so even though some other law may have authorised another person or authority to cancel an allotment.\\nMr. Achhruram, however, contended that the appellants ' rights were protected by section 10 of the .\\nSection 10 runs as follows: 335 \"Special procedure for payment of compensation in certain cases.\\nWhere any immovable property has been leased or allotted to a displaced person by the Custodian under the conditions published (a)by the notification of the Government of Pun.\\njab in the Department of Rehabilitation No. 4892 S or 4892 S dated the 8th July, 1949, or (b)by the notification of the Government of Patiala and East Punjab States Union in the Department of Rehabilitation No. 8R or 9R, dated the 23rd July, 1949, and published in the official Gazette of that State dated the 7th August, 1949, and such property is acquired under the provisions of this Act and forms part of the compensation pool, the displaced person shall, so long as the property remains vested in the Central Government, continue in possession of such property on the same conditions on which he held the property immediately before the date of the acquisition, and the Central Government may, for the purpose of payment of compensation to such displaced person, transfer to him such property on such terms and conditions as may be prescribed.\\n\" It is followed by an explanation; but that explanation has no bearing upon the point urged by Mr. Achhruram.\\nIt is no doubt true that the Raikot lands were allotted to the appellants under the notification referred to in el.\\n(a) of this section and, therefore, they would be entitled to the benefits conferred by this section provided they satisfied all the other requirements of this section, express or implied.\\nIt is implicit in this section that the displaced person to whom land was allotted \"held\" the land and was in possession of such property at the date of the notification.\\nIt is not disputed that the appellants ceased to hold and had lost possession of the Raikot lands before the publication of this notification.\\nEven assuming that the order of the Custodian cancelling the allotment in their favour was erroneous there will be no difference in the result because what is essential is the facts of holding and possession of the land on the date of the notification.\\n336 Mr. Achhruram then referred to the \"Conditions\" on which allotments of land may be made under the notification referred to in sub section\\n10(a) and pointed out that under condition No. 6 the Custodian or rehabilitation authority would be competent to resume or cancel an allotment only on one of the grounds set out in that condition.\\nHe said that the cancellation of the allotment in favour of the appellants was impermissible inasmuch as it was not based upon any of the grounds set out in the 6th condition.\\nThat may or may not be so.\\nWe would repeat that the appellants had lost their possession before the publication of the notification and are thus not entitled to the protection of the section.\\nMoreover, the Custodian, by reason of the divesting of the property, as from March 24, 1955, had become functus officio with respect to it and could not rectify any error made by him in the past in the matter of cancellation of allotment.\\nIt is true that had the appellants been in possession at the critical time they would have had the right to obtain a permanent transfer in their favour of the Raikot lands and by virtue of what happened and without any fault on their part they have been deprived 'of that right.\\nThat is indeed unfortunate but none of the authorities created by the could rectify the wrong that has been done by them to the appellant.\\nThe question whether it could be rectified by any of the authorities constituted by the or not was not canvassed before us and, therefore, there is no occasion for us to say anything about it.\\nMr. Achhruram contended that r. 74 of the Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Rules, 1955 stood in the way of the Custodian allotting the Raikot property to the respondents during the pendency of the proceedings before the Custodian General.\\nThat rule reads as follows: \"Allotments which are the subject matter of dispute.\\nNo property in a rural area in respect of which any case is pending in a Civil Court or before a Deputy Custodian, Custodian or Custodian General, shall be transferred to the allottee\".\\n337 The aforesaid rule is in Chapter X headed \"Payment of compensation under section 10 of the Act\" and deals with a transfer of property to an allottee by way of final settlement of his claim to compensation and does not deal with the question of allotment on a quasi permanent basis.\\nMoreover, this rule applies to a proceeding before an authority created by the and not to an authority created by the .\\nThere is, therefore, no substance in this argument.\\nFinally Mr. Achhruram referred to section 17 of the 1954 Act and to r. 102 of the Rules framed thereunder and said that the powers of the managing officers appointed under the Act are confined only to properties which are entrusted to them for management and not with respect to any other property.\\nSection 17 deals with the function; and duties of managing officers and managing corporation.\\nSub section\\n(1) provides that managing officers and managing corporations will perform such functions as may be assigned to them under the Act.\\nSub section\\n(2) provides that subject to the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder, a managing officer or a managing corporation may, among other things, take such measures as he or it considers it necessary or expedient for the purpose of securing, administering, preserving, managing or disposing of any property in the compensation pool entrusted to him or it. etc.\\nThe argument is that unless there is such \"entrustment\" the managing officer or managing corporation has no function to perform with respect to evacuee property.\\nHis contention appears to be that there is nothing to show that this property was \"entrusted\" to a managing officer.\\nIn the first place the section confers the particular powers On managing officers or managing corporations only and no one else.\\nTherefore, even if no managing officer or managing corporation was appointed with respect to that property no one else could exercise the power of cancellation of allotment.\\nFurther, there is no ground in the special leave petition or in the statement of the 43 338 case that there is no entrustment in fact of this property or this class of properties to a managing officer or managing corporation.\\nHe cannot, therefore, be permitted to make out a new case at this stage of argument.\\nThat apart, this argument assumes that the property, despite the publication of the notification under section 12(1) of the Act continues to be evacuee property.\\nAgain, this provision is a general provision and the particular provision regarding cancellation of allotment is section 19(1) of the Act which does not refer to entrustment at all and it is this provision which must prevail over the general provision.\\nHe then contends that the provisions of section 19(1) of the Act being subject to rules made under the Act must be read along with r. 102 which deals with cancellation of allotments of leases.\\nThat rule reads thus: \"Cancellation of allotments and leases A managing officer or a managing corporation may sell any property in the compensation pool entrusted to him or to it, cancel an allotment or terminate a lease, or vary the terms of any such lease or allotment if the allottee or lessee, as the case may be (a)has sublet or parted with the possession of the whole or any part of the property allotted or leased to him without the permission of a competent authority, or (b)has used or is using such property for a purpose other than that for which it was allotted or leased to him without the permission of a competent authority, or (c) has committed any act which is destructive of or permanently injurious to the property, or (d) for any other sufficient reason to be recorded in writing; Provided that no action shall be taken under this rule unless the allottee or the lessee, as the case may be, has been given a reasonable opportunity of being heard.\\n\" He points out that in the first place, the rule speaks of land 'entrusted ' to the manager and, therefore would operate only if entrustment is established.\\nWhat we have said in regard to section 17 would apply 339 here also.\\nHe then says that this rule restricts the powers of a managing officer or a managing corporation in the matter of cancellation of allotment in the sense that it permits cancellation only on certain specified grounds and, therefore, it cannot be said that section 19(1) of the Act is completely in conflict with section 10 of the in so far as the question of cancellation of allotment is concerned.\\nWe cannot accept the

Text: Appeal No. 52 of 1957.\\nAppeal from the judgment and decree dated April 22, of 1953, of the Patna High Court in Appeal from Original Decree No. 162 of 1946.\\nK.N. Bhattacharya and P. K. Chatterjee, for appellants.\\nN.C. Chatterjee, A. V. Viswanatha Sastri, R. section Chatterji and D. N. Mukherjee, for respondents Nos. 2 to 6. 1961.\\nMarch 22.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by SUBBA RAO, J.\\nThis appeal by certificate granted is directed against the judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Patna dated April 23, 1953, confirming that of the Subordinate Judge, Dhanbad, dated November 30, 1946.\\nThe plaintiffs and the defendant are adjoining colliery owners at Kujama.\\nThe plaintiffs ' land lies immediately to the south of the defendants ' land.\\nOn August 2, 1,894, Raja of Jharia granted mukarrari lease of the coal and coal mining rights in 300 bighas of land in village Kujama to Satya Karan Banerjee and Girish Chandra Samanta.\\nOn June 15,1900, his son, Raja Durga Prasad Singh, granted coal and coal 494 mining rights in respect of 400 bighas out of 592 bighas to one Jugal Kishore Lal.\\nSamanta purchased the leasehold interest of Banerji, and thereafter on November 23, 1900, it appears that Samanta bad surrendered his rights under the previous lease in favour of the Raja and taken a fresh lease of the same 300 bighas on a reduced rent.\\nOn June 10, 1901, Jugal Kishore Lal granted a lease of 96 bighas out of his 400 bighas to one D. M. Mathews.\\nOn the very same day D. M. Mathews, in his turn, granted a lease to one Walji Kheta in respect of the said 96 bighas.\\nWalji Kheta executed a kabuliat in favour of M. Mathews on October 11, 1901.\\nWalji Kheta represented the defendants.\\nBy diverse transfers, the interest of Samanata vested in Bagdigi Kujama Collieries Limited.\\nThe plaintiffs case was that as a result of a letter written by the Inspector of Mines on August 18, 1941, the plaintiffs made an inquiry and came to know that the defendants had encroached upon their coal mines on the northern side and removed coal from the encroached portion and had rendered the remaining coal of the encroached portion unworkable.\\nOn those allegations, they asked for the following reliefs: (a)That the intermediate boundary line between the plaintiffs ' coal land and the defendants ' coal land be ascertained and fixed.\\n(b)That the area encroached upon by the defendants be ascertained and the defendants be directed to vacate the same,.\\n(c)That a permanent injunction be issued against the defendants restraining them from encroaching upon the plaintiffs ' coal land and cutting and removing coal therefrom.\\n(d)That an enquiry be made and the quantity of coal cut and removed by the defendants from the plaintiffs ' coal land as also the quantity of the coal rendered unworkable be ascertained and a decree for the value thereof by way of damages be granted to the plaintiffs against the defendants.\\nThe defendants denied that they had encroached upon the plaintiff , ' coal land and stated that the suit was barred by limitation.\\nThey further pleaded that the 495 plaintiffs would not be entitled to any damages.\\nThe learned Subordinate Judge held that the defendant had encroached upon the plaintiff ' coal land, that the suit was not barred by limitations and that they would be entitled to the reliefs prayed for.\\nOn appeal, the High Court of Patna accepted all the findings of the learned Subordinate Judge and dismissed the appeal.\\nHence the present appeal.\\nThe first question that arises for consideration is whether the defendants had encroached Upon the plaintiffs ' coal land.\\nThe answer to this question depends upon the correct, delineation of the boundary line between the plaintiffs ' leasehold and the defendants ' leasehold.\\nIt is common case that the southern boundary of the appellants ' leasehold is conterminous with the northern boundary of the respondents ' lease hold.\\nLearned counsel for the appellant contends that the said boundary should be fixed solely with reference to the boundaries given in the lease of 1894, whereas learned counsel for the respondents contends that no plan has been annexed to the said lease and, therefore, the boundary could more satisfactorily and definitely be fixed with reference to the plans annexed to the subsequent lease deeds executed in favour of the successors in interest of the appellant and the respondents.\\nTo appreciate the rival contentions it is necessary to consider the various lease deeds in some detail.\\nOn August 2, 1894, Raja Jaimangal Singh executed the lease deed (exhibit 1) in respect of 300 bighas in favour of the respondents ' predecessor in interest.\\nIn that lease deed the northern boundary is described to be the remaining portion of mauza Kujama and the western boundary is described as Chatkari Jorh.\\nThe foot note to the lease reads, \"measuring 1101 feet in length running north and south by the side of the said Chatkari Jorh and area being 300 bighas by such measurement\".\\nNo plan was annexed to this lease deed.\\nOn June 15, 1900, Jugal Kishore Lal, the predecessor in interest of the appellant, had obtained a lease (exhibit C) of 400 bighas 496 from Raja Durga Prasad Singh, the son of the previous Raja.\\nThe southern boundary of this leasehold is given as the northern boundary limit of the leasehold land of Girish Chandra Samanta and others and the western boundary is shown as the eastern boundary of Chatkari Jorh as per the map annexed.\\nThis lease deed clearly shows that the southern boundary of this plot is conterminous with the northern boundary of the leasehold land in favour of Samanta.\\nIt may also be noticed at this stage that the map annexed to this lease deed has not been filed by the appellants.\\nIt appears that Samanta purchased the interest of Banerji in the leasehold of 1894 and thereafter at the request of Samanta, on November 23, 1900, Durga Prasad Singh gave a fresh lease of the same holding to Samanta and incorporated a map in that lease, i.e., exhibit 3(b).\\nThere, the northern boundary of the leasehold is described as the leasehold of Rajkumar Jugal Kishore Lal Singh Bahadur.\\nThe plan, exhibit 3(b), annexed to this lease deed shows the boundary line between the two leaseholds.\\nThe said plan is drawn to scale and the boundary line is drawn between point A marked in the plan and point B marked therein.\\nAs the plan is a part of the lease deed, it is clear from the plan that the northern boundary of the leasehold of Samanta is the said line.\\nOn June 10, 1901, Jugal Kishore Lal, that is, the predecessor in interest of the appellant demised a plot of 96 bighas carved out from his leasehold to Mathews under a deed exhibit C(1).\\nMathews in turn demised under exhibit D the said land of 96 bighas to Walji Khetan representing the appellant.\\nIn both these documents the southern boundary is shown as the northern boundary of the leasehold land of Samanta.\\nOne interesting feature is that a map has been referred to in each of the documents and the said map shows that the line drawn from point A to point B is the boundary between the two leaseholds.\\nIt may be mentioned that the said boundary line is exactly the same as that found in exhibit 3(b).\\nThese documents to which the defendants ' predecessors were parties contain a clear admission that the boundary line between the two leaseholds i.e., between appellant 's and that of the respondents ' is the line between 497 A and B shown in plan exhibit 3(b).\\nWe have no doubt that if the plan annexed to exhibit C was produced by the appellant, it would have also established that the dividing line between the two leaseholds is that found in exhibit 3(b).\\nThe appellant, in our view, has suppressed the said plan and, therefore, in the circumstances, we are justified to draw an inference that, if produced, it would be against appellant 's contention.\\nFrom the aforesaid documentary evidence we hold, agreeing with the courts below, that the southern boundary of the appellant 's holding, which is conterminous with the northern boundary of the respondents ' holding, is the line between points A and B shown in exhibit 3(b).\\nThe next question addressed by the courts below is how to ascertain the point A.\\nThe argument of learned counsel for the appellant is that the map translated into words indicates that the correct boundary should be a line drawn from the true meeting point of the four villages Pandebera, Jharia Khas, Lodhna and Kujama at a bearing of 82.15 ', whereas the contention of the respondents is that the line actually drawn on the lease map correctly lays down the northern boundary of the respondents ' leasehold.\\nIt is settled law that a map referred to in a lease should be treated as incorporated in the lease and as forming part of the document: see Darapali Sadagar vs Najir Ahamed (1).\\nAs in this case the map is drawn to scale and incorporated in the lease deed, it is not permissible to ignore the starting point of the boundary line and adopt instead any scientific point based on survey.\\nThe Commissioner appointed by the court tested the position of the six trijunction pillars shown in the map of lease dated November 23, 1900, and found that two of the trijunction pillars were in their correct positions.\\nOn the basis of these two trijunction pillars, the Commissioner relaid, by the process of superimposition, the northern boundary line of the leasehold property, The point A in the map so laid does not tally with the point where the aforesaid four villages actually meet.\\nHe pointed out that the correct (1)(1923) I.L.R 50 Cal 394 63 498 point where the said four villages met would be 1680 feet only from the trijunction pillar of Lodhna, Kujama and Madhuban, whereas the point A was at a distance of 1750 feet from the said trijunction pillar.\\nBut learned counsel for the appellant contends that according to exhibit 3 the western boundary should be according to the revenue plan and, therefore, point A should be fixed at a distance of 1680 feet from the trijunction pillar, as that is the distance according to the revenue plan.\\nBut a perusal of exhibit I shows that there is no reference in regard to the western boundary to revenue records.\\nThat apart, even if 1680 feet is taken as the distance between the injunction pillar and point A in 'the map, it demonstrates that the measurement given in exhibit 3 was incorrect, for, there the distance was shown only as 1101 feet.\\nBut a more serious objection to the argument is that it is not permissible for a court to reconstruct the plan with reference to revenue records when the plan is self contained and drawn to scale.\\nTo summarize: the question is whether the disputed extent is part of the respondents ' holding or that of the appellant 's holding.\\nThe map, exhibit 3(b), annexed to the lease deed executed in favour of the respondents ' predecessor in interest clearly demarcates the boundary line between the holdings of the appellant and the respondents, and according to that plan the disputed extent falls within the boundary of the respondents ' holding.\\nThe lease of the appellant 's predecessor, i.e., exhibit C, also refers to a map, but the appellant withheld it.\\nIn the sub leases created by the appellant, maps were annexed and the boundary therein is in accord with that in exhibit 3(b).\\nThose documents contain clear admissions supporting the case of the respondents.\\nNo reliance can be placed upon the recitals in exhibit 1, as it is demonstrated that the extent given in respect of the western boundary is incorrect.\\nOn the aforesaid material both the courts have held that the disputed extent of land is part of the holding of the respondents.\\nIt is well settled that a map referred to in a lease should be treated as incorporated in the lease and as 499 forming part of the said document.\\nIn this case the maps accepted by us are drawn to scale and the boundary is clearly demarcated.\\nThe courts were, therefore, certainly right in accepting the boundaries drawn in the plan without embarking upon an attempt to correct them with reference to revenue records.\\nThe question really is one of fact and we accept the finding.\\nThe next question is whether the suit was barred by limitation.\\nThe encroachment by the appellant on the respondents ' colliery and the removal of coal therefrom are alleged to have taken place in or about the year 1932.\\nThe respondents in the plaint averred that they came to know of the said encroachment and removal of coal by the appellant after they received the letter dated August 18, 1941, from the Inspector of Mines and before that they had absolutely no knowledge or information whatsoever regarding thereto.\\nThe appellant denied the said allegation and stated that the respondents all along knew and had been aware that the portion of coal land in question belonged to and was the property of the appellant.\\nIn particular the appellant alleged that the respondents must have the knowledge of it since 1932 when there was a survey by the Department of Mines.\\nOn the said pleadings issue 3 was framed which reads, \"Is the suit barred by limitation?\" The learned Subordinate Judge found, on the evidence, that the proceedings in 1932 had nothing to do with the delineation of the boundary line between the two holdings.\\nHe held that article 48 of the Limitation Act applied to the suit and that the appellant had failed to prove that the respondents had knowledge of the sinking of the quarries and pits in the encroached land.\\nOn appeal the High Court accepted the finding.\\nThough the High Court held that the burden of proof to establish knowledge on the part of the respondents beyond the prescribed time was on the appellant, it has given the finding on the assumption that the initial burden was on the respondents to prove that they had knowledge of the said encroachment only within three years thereof.\\nThere are, therefore, concurrent findings of fact on the 500 question of knowledge.\\nBut learned counsel for the appellant contended that the finding is vitiated by the burden of proof having been wrongly thrown on the appellant.\\nThis submission is not accurate, for, as we have pointed out, the High Court arrived at the finding of fact on the assumption that the initial burden of proof was on the respondents.\\nIt is common case that article 48 of the Limitation Act governs the period of limitation in respect of the present suit.\\nIt reads: ___________________________________________________________ Period Time from Description of suit.\\nof which period limitation begins to run.\\n___________________________________________________________ For specific moveable When the per property lost, or son having acquired by theft, or the right to dishonest misappro the posses priation or conver Three sion of the sion, or for com years.\\nproperty first pensation for wrong learns in ful taking or detain whose posses ing the same.\\nsion itis.\\n__________________________________________________________ The article says that a suit for recovery of specific movable property acquired by conversion or for compensation for wrongful taking or detaining of the suit property should be filed within three years from the date when the person having the right to the possession of the property first learns in whose possession it is.\\nThe question is, on whom the burden to prove the said knowledge lies? The answer will be clear if the article is read as follows: A person having the right to the possession of a property wrongfully taken from him by another can file a suit to recover the said specific moveable property or for compensation therefore within three years from the date when lie first learns in whose possession it is.\\nObviously where a person has a right to sue within three years from the date of his coming to know of a, certain fact, it is for him to prove that he had the knowledge of the said fact on a particular date, for 501 the said fact would be within his peculiar knowledge.\\nThat apart, section 3 of the Limitation Act makes it obligatory on a court to dismiss a suit barred by limitation, although limitation has not been set up as a defence, indicating thereby that it is the duty of a plaintiff to establish, at any rate prima facie, that the suit is within time.\\nIt is the obligation of the plaintiff to satisfy the court that his action is not barred by lapse of time: see Lalchand Marwari vs Mahanth Rampur Gir (1) and Rajah Sahib Perhlad Sein vs Maharajah Rajender Kishore Sing (2) .\\nLooking from a different perspective, we arrive at the same result.\\nUnder the Evidence Act there is an essential distinction between the phrase \"burden of proof\" as a matter of law and pleading and as a matter of adducing evidence.\\nUnder section 101 of the Evidence Act, the burden in the former sense is upon the party who comes to court to get a decision on the existence of certain facts which he asserts.\\nThat burden is constant throughout the trial; but the burden to prove in the sense of adducing evidence shifts from time to time having regard to the evidence adduced by one party or the other or the presumption of fact or law raised in favour of one or the other.\\nIn the present case the burden of proof in the former sense is certainly on the respondents.\\nBut the question is whether they have adduced evidence which had the effect of shifting the onus of proof to the appellant.\\nOn behalf of the respondents, their Colliery Manager was examined as P. W. 2.\\nHe stated in his evidence that the appellant had encroached upon the South Kujamal Colliery in Seam Nos. 10, 11 and 12 and another special seam, known as 4 feet seam and that in August, 1941, be came to know about the encroachment for the first time when the Mines Department forwarded a plan of the joint workings of the two collieries of the parties.\\nHe also stated that he had no knowledge of the encroachment before.\\nIn the cross examination, two suggestions were made to him, namely, that in 1932 there was a survey of the plaintiffs ' and defendants ' coal land by the Mines Department and that Seam Nos. 11 and 12 were (1) Pat. 312.\\n(2) (1869) 12 M.I.A. 292.\\n502 worked by the appellant by open quarry system.\\nHe denied that he had any knowledge of the said two facts.\\nThe evidence of this witness has been accepted by the learned Subordinate Judge, and the High Court also accepted his evidence, though in its view it was not very satisfactory.\\nThis evidence, therefore, prima facie, proves that the respondents had knowledge of the encroachment only in 1941.\\nLet us now consider some of the decisions cited at the Bar.\\nA division beach of the Patna High Court in Sundarji Shivji vs Secretary of State for India (1) held that \"when a defendant in an action based on tort seeks to show that the suit is not maintainable by reason of the expiry of the statutory period of limitation, it is upon him to prove the necessary facts\".\\nThere the suit was for conversion of property, and the learned Judges applied article 48 of the Limitation Act to the said suit.\\nAfter noticing the words in the last column of the article, the learned Judges proceeded to observe thus: \" The starting date of limitation in the case of conversion is the date when the person who has the right to possession first learns of the act of conversion.\\n\" Adverting to the burden of proof, the learned Judges observed: \"There is nothing in the pleadings which would show precisely at what period tile plaintiff or the plaintiff 's agent, which is the same thing, became aware of the sale and its wrongfulness, that is to say, became aware of the fact of conversion.\\nThe defendant was unable to provide us with any materials to fix that date and therefore his plea of limitation fails altogether, because he is unable to show a date outside the period of three years which would entitle him to succeed.\\n\" With great respect to the learned Judges, we hold that this case had not been correctly decided.\\nThe burden of proof, as we have explained earlier is on a plaintiff who asserts a right,</td>\n",
                            "      <td>Summary:\\nThe appellants and the respondents were owners of adjoining collieries and the suit out of which the present appeal arose was one brought by the respondents for certain reliefs on the allegation that the appellants had encroached upon their coal mines and removed coal from the encroached portion and that they came to know of the said encroachment and removal of coal after they had received the letter dated August 18, 1941, from the Inspector of Mines.\\nThe appellant denied the encroachment and pleaded that the suit was barred by limitation inasmuch as the respondents had knowledge of the encroachment in 1932 then there was a survey by the Department of Mines.\\nThe trial judge found on evidence that the proceedings in 1932 had nothing to do with the matter, held that article 48 of the Limitation Act applied to the suit and that the appellants had failed to prove that the respondents had knowledge of the sinking of the quarries and pits in the encroached land and decreed the suit.\\nThe High Court on appeal accepted the finding of the trial court and although it placed the burden of proving knowledge on the part of the respondents beyond the prescribed time on the appellants, nevertheless proceeded on the assumption that the initial burden to prove that they had knowledge of the said encroachment within the period was on the respondents and affirmed the decree of the trial court.\\nHeld, that the burden of proof had not been misplaced.\\nUnder article 48 of the Indian Limitation Act, which prescribes a three years ' limitation from the date of the knowledge, the initial onus is obviously on the plaintiff to prove that date since it would be within his special knowledge.\\nMoreover, under section 3 of the Act, which makes its obligatory on the court to dismiss a suit barred by limitation, even though such a plea is not set up in defence, it is for the plaintiff to establish that the suit is not so barred.\\nLalchand Marwari vs Mahant Rampur Gir, pat.\\n(P.C.) 312 and Rajah Sahib Perhalad Seim vs Maharajah Rajender Kishore Singh, (1869) 12 M.I.A. 292, referred to.\\nUnder the there is an essential distinc tion between burden of proof as a matter of law and pleading and as a matter of adducing evidence and under section 101 of the 493 Act the burden in the former sense is always on the plaintiff and never shifts, but the burden in the latter sense may according to the evidence led by the parties and presumptions of law or fact raised in their favour.\\nSundarji Shivji vs Secretary of State for India, Pat. 752, disapproved.\\nKalyani Prasad Singh vs Borrea Coal Co.

No. 46/59).\\n926 1960.\\nSeptember 27.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS GUPTA J.\\nM/s.\\nDaulatram Rameshwarlal, a firm registered under the Indian Partnership Act (referred to later in this judgment as \"sellers \") are registered dealers under section 11 of the Bombay Sales Tax Act.\\nIn their return of turnover for the period from April 1, 1954 to March 31, 1955, they claimed exemption from Sales Tax in respect of sales of cotton of the total value of Rs. 68,493 2 6 and sales of castor oil of the total value of Rs. 6,47,509 1 6 on the ground that these sales were oil FOB contracts, under which they continued to be the owners of the goods till the goods had crossed the customs barrier and thus entered the export stream, and so no tax was realisable on these sales in view of the provisions of article 286 (1)(b).\\nThe Sales Tax Officer rejected this claim for exemption and assessed them to sales tax on a taxable turnover including these sales.\\nHe also assessed them to purchase tax under section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act on their purchase of castor oil which they later sold for the sum of Rs. 6,47,509 1 6 as mentioned above.\\nThe notice of demand for the total sales tax and the purchase tax assessed was served on the sellers on September 30, 1956.\\nThe sellers thereupon moved the Bombay High Court under article 226 of the Constitu tion for the issue of appropriate writs for quashing the order of assessment and the notice of demand and for prohibiting the Sales Tax Officer from taking any steps pursuant to the order or the notice.\\nThe learned Judge who heard the petition rejected the sellers ' contention that the goods remained their property till these crossed the customs frontier and therefore held that the sellers were not entitled to the benefit of article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution.\\nAs regards the assessment to purchase tax also he rejected the sellers ' contention that the assessment in question was illegal.\\nIn this view the learned Judge dismissed the application under article 226.\\nAgainst this decision the sellers appealed.\\nThe 927 learned Judges who heard the appeal held, disagreeing with the Trial Judge, that the goods remained the sellers ' property till the goods had been brought on board the ship and so the sales were exempted from tax under article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution.\\nThey however agreed with the Trial Judger that the sellers were liable to pay purchase tax under section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act.\\nAccordingly they directed the Sales Tax Officer not to enforce the demand for payment of sales tax with regard to the sales of cotton for Rs. 68,493 2 6 and sale of castor oil of the total value of Rs. 6,47,509 1 6.\\nThe Sales Tax Officer has, on the strength of special leave granted by this Court, preferred the appeal which has been numbered as Civil Appeal No. 45 of 1959 against the appellate court 's order directing him not to realise the sales tax in respect of sales of cotton and castor oil.\\nCivil Appeal No. 46 of 1959 has been preferred by the sellers against the appellate court 's judgment in so far as it upheld the assessment of purchase tax under section 10(b).\\nThe only \"question for our decision in the appeal by the Sales Tax Officer is whether property in the goods passed on shipment or at some point of time before shipment.\\nThe law is now well settled that if the property in the goods passes to the buyer after they have for the purpose of export to a foreign country crossed the customs frontier the sale has taken place \"in course of the export\" out of the territory of India.\\nIf therefore in the present sales the property in the goods passed to the buyers on shipment, that is, after they had crossed the customs frontier the sales must be held to have taken place \"in the course of export\" and the exemption under article 286(1)(b) will come into operation.\\nThe sellers ' case is that these were sales on FOB contracts.\\nThough the learned Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the Sales Tax Officer tried to convince us that these were not really FOB contract sales, it appears that the averment in Paras.\\n11 and 13 of the writ petition that these sales were made on FOB basis were not denied in the counter affidavit sworn by the Sales Tax Officer.\\nIt is also 928 worth noticing that in the assessment order itself the Sale Tax Officer referred to these sales as sales on FOB basis.\\nThe specimen contract produced also used the words \" FOB delivered \".\\nThere can be no doubt therefore that these were sales under FOB contracts. ' The normal rule in FOB contracts is that the property is intended to pass and does pass on the shipment of the goods.\\nIn certain circumstances, e.g., if the seller takes the bill of , lading to his own order and parts with it to a third person the property in the goods, it has been held, does not pass to the buyer even on shipment.\\nWe are not concerned here with the question whether the passing of property in the goods was postponed even after shipment.\\nThe correctness of the proposition that in the absence of special agreement the property in the goods does not pass in the case of a FOB contract until the goods are actually put on board is not disputed before us.\\nAs has however been rightly stressed by the learned Solicitor General it is always open to the parties to come to a different agreement as to when the Dropert in the goods shall pass.\\nThe question whether there was such a different agreement has to be decided on a consideration of all the surrounding circumstances.\\nHe relies on three circumstances to convince us that the sellers and their buyers agreed in these sales that the property will pass to the buyer even before shipment.\\nThe first circumstance on which he relies is that the bill of lading was taken in the name of the buyer.\\nAlong with this fact we have to consider however the fact that the bill of lading was retained by the sellers, the contract being that payment will be made on the presentation of the bill of lading.\\nIt is not disputed that the term in the contract for \"payment at Bombay against presentation of documents \" means this.\\nIt was the sellers who received the bills of lading and it was on the presentation of these bills of lading along with the invoices that the buyer paid the price.\\nWhen the bills of lading though made out as if the goods were shipped by the buyer, were actually obtained and retained by the sellers, that fact itself would ordinarily indicate an intention of 929 the parties that the property in the goods would not pass till after payment.\\nThe second circumstance to which our attention has been drawn is that the export was under the contract to be under the buyer 's export licence.\\nThis, in our opinion, shows nothing.\\nThe ordinary rule in FOB contracts is that it is the duty of the buyer to obtain the necessary export licence.\\nThat was laid down in Brandt 's case (1) and though in a later case in Hardy vs Pound (2) the Court of Appeal in England held that the judgment in Brandt 's case (1) does not cover every FOB contract and that in the special facts of the particular case before them it was for the sellers to obtain the licence and this view was approved by the House of Lords , it is in our opinion correct to state that the presumption in FOB contracts is that it is the duty of the buyers to obtain export licence, though in the circumstances of a particular case this duty may fall on the sellers.\\nThe third circumstance on which reliance is placed on behalf of the Sales Tax Officer is that the Export Control Order, 1954, which was passed in the exercise of powers conferred by Import &amp; Export Control Act, 1947, contained a provision in its clause 5(2) in these words: \" It shall be deemed to be a condition of that licence. . . that the goods for the export of which licence is granted shall be the property of the licensee at the time of the export \".\\nIt has been strenuously contended by the learned Solicitor General that it will be reasonable to think that the parties to the contract intended to comply with this condition and to agree as between themselves that the goods shall be the property of the licensee, that is, the buyer, at the time of the export.\\nIt is argued that the time of the export should be interpreted as the time when the customs frontier is crossed and that we must proceed on the basis that the buyer and the sellers intended that the goods shall be the buyer 's property at the point of time when they crossed this frontier.\\nWe see however no justification for thinking that in this clause \"the time of the export \" means the time (1) (2) 930 when the goods cross the customs frontier.\\nExport has been defined in the Import &amp; Export (Control) Act, 1947, as \" taking out of India by sea, land or air \".\\nIn the Exports (Control) Order, 1954, the word must be taken to have the same meaning as in the Act.\\nOn that definition the time of the export is the time when the goods go out of the territorial limits of India.\\nThese territorial limits would include the territorial waters of India.\\nConsequently the time of the export is when the ship with the goods goes be yond the territorial limits.\\nAt any rate, the export of the goods cannot be considered to have commenced before the ship carrying goods leaves the port.\\nThe intention of the parties that in compliance with the requirements of cl.\\n5(2) of the Exports (Control) Order the goods shall be the property of the licensee at the time of the export would therefore mean nothing more than that the property in the goods shall pass immediately before the ship goes beyond the territorial waters of the country, or at the earliest when the ship leaves the port.\\nWhichever view is taken there is nothing to indicate that the intention to comply with the requirements of el.\\n5(2) of the Exports (Control) Order carries with it an intention that the property should pass to the buyer at the time the goods cross the customs frontier.\\nIt is true that in the United Motor '8 Case (1) and in other cases it has been held by this Court that the course of export commences to run when the goods cross the customs barrier.\\nWhat the court had to consider in these cases was not however when export commences within the meaning of the Exports (Control) Order but when the course of export commences for the purpose of article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution.\\nFor the reasons which need not be detailed here it was decided that the course of export commences at the time when the goods cross the customs barrier.\\nThese decisions as regards the commencement of the course of export are of no assistance in deciding about the point of time when the export proper commences.\\nAs we have already pointed out when export has been defined in the Import &amp; Export (1) (1953) 4 S.T.C. 133. 931 (Control) Act, 1947, as \"taking out of India by land, sea, or air \", export in the Export Control Order, cannot be held to have commenced till at least the ship carrying the goods has left the port, though it may in some contexts be more correct to say that it does not commence till the ship has passed beyond the territorial waters.\\nWe have therefore come to the conclusion that there is no circumstance which would justify a conclusion that the parties came to a special agreement that though the sales were on FOB contracts property in the goods would pass to the buyer at some point of time before shipment.\\nWe think that the learned judges who heard the appeal in the Bombay High Court were right in their conclusion that the goods remained the sellers ' property till the goods had been brought and loaded on board the ship and so the sales were exempted from tax under article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution.\\nIn Civil Appeal No. 46 of 1959 the appellants ' contention is that on a correct interpretation of the provisions of section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act no purchase tax was leviable from them.\\nSection 10(b) provides for the levy of a purchase tax on the turnover of purchase of goods specified in column I of Schedule B, at the rates, if any, specified against such goods in column 4 of the said schedule, \"where a certificate under cl.\\n(b) of section 8 has been furnished in respect of such goods and the purchasing dealer does not show to the satisfaction of the Collector that the goods have been despatched by him or by a person to whom he has sold the goods to an address outside the State of Bombay within a period of six months from the date of purchase by the dealer furnishing such certificate \".\\nSection 8(b) provides for the deduction from the turnover, of sale of goods to a dealer who holds an authorisation and furnishes to the selling dealer a certificate in the prescribed form declaring inter alia that the goods so sold to him are intended for being despatched by him or by registered dealers to whom he sells the goods to an address outside the State of Bombay.\\nAdmittedly such a certificate was furnished by 932 M/s. Daulatram Rameshwarlal in respect of the castor oil which they sold to others and that in respect of these sales to them their sellers were allowed deductions.\\nIt is equally undisputed that the persons to whom M/s. Daulatram Rameshwarlal sold the goods were sent to an address outside the State of Bombay within a period of six months from the date of purchase by M/s. Daulatram Rameshwarlal.\\nThese persons are however not registered dealers.\\nThe Sales Tax Officer as also the High Court of Bombay has held that the \" person to whom he has sold the goods \" in section 10(b) means \" a registered dealer to whom he has sold the goods \".\\nIt is contended before us on behalf of the appellant dealers that the word \" a person \" is wide enough to include a registered dealer and an unregistered dealer.\\nIt is urged that the use of the word it a person \" instead of the words \" a registered dealer \" is deliberate and that it was the intention of the Legislature to levy purchase tax on a person who has given such certificate under section 8(b) only if the goods were not 'despatched outside the State of Bombay within the prescribed period by anybody.\\nIt is therefore contended that \" a person \" in section 8(b) should be interpreted to include a registered dealer or anybody else.\\nWe are unable to agree.\\nA close examination of sections 8 and 10 justifies the conclusion that the Legislature was anxious to secure that the declaration as regards intention of the goods being despatched outside the State of Bombay should be carried out by despatch by \" a registered dealer \" to whom he sells the goods.\\nIf such despatch outside the State of Bombay is by a person to whom the certifying dealer has sold the goods but who is not a registered dealer the certificate has not been complied with.\\nIt will be in our opinion unreasonable to think that though the Legislature insisted that the certificate should declare the goods purchased were intended 11 for being despatched by him or by a registered dealer to whom he sells the goods outside the State of Bombay \", the Legislature would be content to accept actual despatch outside the State of Bombay by one who is not a registered dealer as sufficient.\\nMr. Sanyal contended that the certificate 933 has to declare only an intention and that if ultimately the actual despatch is made by some person who is not a registered dealer, it cannot strictly be said that the declaration has not been carried out.\\nIt might very well be that if at the time a declaration of intention is made in the certificate the purchasing dealer had the intention as stated and ultimately he sells to a person who is not a registered dealer for despatch of the goods outside the State of Bombay, the purchasing dealer may not be liable for having made a false declaration \".\\nEven though he has not made a false declaration of his intention, the fact remains that the intention declared has not been carried out.\\nThe scheme of the Legislature clearly is that where the intention as declared has not been carried out purchase tax should be levied.\\nTo hold otherwise would be to make the declaration of the intention useless.\\nOur conclusion therefore is that the courts below have rightly interpreted the words \" a person \" in section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act as a \" registered dealer \" and that the purchasing dealers have rightly been assessed to purchase tax under section 10(b).\\nIn the result, both the appeals are dismissed with costs.\\nAppeals dismissed.</td>\n",

Text: ION: Criminal Appeal 89 of 1961.\\nAppeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated December 8, 1960, of the Allahabad High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 1782 of 60 and Referred No. 125 of 1960, section K. Kapur, for the appellant, G. C. Mathur and C. P. Lal, for the respondent.\\nDecember 19.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by RAGUHBAR DAYAL, J.\\nRam Singh appeals, by special leave, against the order of the Allahabad High Court dismissing his appeal and confirming 204 his conviction and sentence of death, under section 302, I.P.C., by the Session Judge, Etawah.\\nThe prosecution case, in brief, is that due to enmity, the appellant caused injuries to Sheo Sahai, who was sleeping in his cattle shed in village Bhadurpur Ghar, with a sword at about mid night on the night between June 14 15, 1960.\\nSheo Sahai died of the injuries received.\\nThe appellant thereafter proceeded to the Canal Distributory at some distance from the village and had a bath there.\\nLater on, he went to the Police Station, Ekdil, nine miles away and lodged a report.\\nHe delivered the sword which has been found by the Serologist to be stained with human blood.\\nThe appellant was taken in custody and as a result of the investigation was sent up for trial, The appellant denied the allegation that he had caused the death of Sheo Sahai and alleged that he was falsely accused of the offence.\\nHe also denied the other allegations for the prosecution.\\nHe alleged that one Paley Singh informed him about the murder of Sheo Sahai and asked him to go to the Police Station, Ekdil, and to inform the Station Officer orally about the murder.\\nHe did accordingly.\\nHe was detained at the Police Station till 11 a.m., the next day and was then put up in the lock up.\\nThe Sub Inspector took his thumb impression forcibly on three papers, but did not tell him the reason.\\nThe appellant adduced no evidence in support of his statement.\\nThe Courts below rightly did not accept his version.\\nThe evidence led by the prosecution consisted of the evidence relating to motive, to his extrajudicial confession to one Ujagar Singh when he was having a bath in the Canal, to his purchasing the sword and to his delivering it at the police Station after he had dictated the report.\\nBoth the Courts below rightly believed the evidence about the motive and purchase of the sword by the appellant.\\n205 The learned Sessions Judge believed Ujagar Singh and acted on the extra judicial confession made by the appellant to him.\\nThe High Court, however, did not rely on this extra judicial confession.\\nIt relied on certain statements made by the appellant in his report dictated at the Police Station and considered those facts together with the motive and the evidence about the purchase of the sword sufficient to confirm the appellant 's conviction and sentence.\\nThe learned counsel for the appellant has argued that the entire report dictated by the appellant was inadmissible in evidence as its contents amounted to a confession of the offence by the appellant made to a Police Officer and that the evidence relied upon by the High Court was insufficient to establish that the appellant had murdered Sheo Sahai.\\nOn the other hand, learned Counsel for the respondent urged that the High Court was wrong in rejecting the statement of Ujagar Singh about the appellant 's extra judicial confession and that the extra judicial confession together with the circumstances relied on by the High Court, fully make out the prosecution case against the appellant.\\nHe also urges that such portions of the report which did not amount to a direct admission of the appellant 's striking Sheo Sahai with a sword and thereby causing his death were admissible in evidence.\\nWe do not consider it necessary to decide whether any portion of the report dictated by the appellant at the Police Station is admissible or not in evidence, as there is good independent evidence with respect to the four matters mentioned in the report and relied on by the High Court in considering the case against the appellant.\\nThese admissions of the appellant are (i) that he purchased a cycle from the deceased; (ii) that there was a quarrel in a play of cards; (iii) that he purchased a sword; and (iv) that he deposited the sword at the Police Station.\\n206 Ajit Singh, P.W., 5 deposed about the purchase of the cycle and about a dispute taking place between Sheo Sahai and the appellant on account of the latter 's demanding the return of Rs. 10/ which had been paid towards the sale price as the balance of the sale price had not been paid and the deal was cancelled by Sheo Sahai in accordance with the oral contract.\\nAjit Singh bears no enmity with the appellant.\\nIn fact, none of the prosecution witnesses is alleged to bear enmity with the appellant.\\nPaley Singh, P.W. 2, and Baij Nath P.W. 4, depose about the dispute during the game of cards played on June 12, 1960.\\nKehar Singh P.W.3.\\ndeposed about the selling of a sword to the appellant on June 13, 1960.\\nA receipt about the sale was found on the person of the appellant when he was searched after his arrest.\\nThe appellant 's depositing the sword at the Police Station is deposed by Madho Ram P.W. 12, and by Sri Kishan Singh, Station Officer, Ekdil, (P.W. 16), in whose presence the appellant had dictated the report.\\nIt is therefore not necessary to rely on the admissions of the appellant in the report with respect to these facts deposed to by the various witnesses whose testimony has been rightly accepted.\\nWe need also consider whether the facts that the accused had a motive to harm Sheo Sahai and that he had purchased a sword a day before the incident and deposited it stained with human blood at the Police Station on the night of the murder are sufficient to establish that it must be the appellant who committed the murder of Sheo Sahai or not, as we are of opinion that the High Court erred in rejecting the statement of Ujagar Singh about the appellant 's confessing to him that he had murdered Sheo Sahai.\\n207 In this connection, the High Court simply said: \"A perusal of the statement of Ujagar Singh would show that it is very likely that this may have happened.\\nTo us, it seems that in the middle of June when the chari and sugar cane crop would not have been very high, it seems improbable that Ujagar Singh would have been sleeping in his field or that he should have met the appellant in the manner alleged.\\nWe do not feel sure of the extra judicial confession said to have been made by the appellant to Ujagar Singh, and consequently we do not place any reliance on his statement, though it has been relied upon by the court below.\\n\" With respect to the learned Judges, these observations are not very consistent.\\nIf Ujagar Singh 's statement made it very likely that what he stated did happen, there could not have appeared any improbability in Ujagar Singh 's sleeping in his field and meeting the appellant in the manner alleged, especially when the learned Judges believed, and there was evidence about it, that the fields had chari and sugarcane crop at the time.\\nThe learned Judges have not stated those considerations, if any, in addition to the improbability of Ujagar Singh 's presence in his field on account of the crops being not very high, which made them doubt the appellant 's confessing to Ujagar Singh.\\nIt may be mentioned that Ujagar Singh was on the field, according to his statement, for protecting the crop from the depradations of neel gais.\\nThey damage the leaves of the plants and have no partiality for tall plants alone.\\nIn fact, the smaller the plants, the easier it must be to graze.\\nThe learned Sessions Judge has discussed the criticism urged before him against the acceptance of the statement of Ujagar Singh and considered 208 it, for reasons given, not to justify the rejection of Ujagar Singh 's statement.\\nWe agree with those reasons.\\nThere is no enmity between Ujagar Singh and the appellant and therefore no good reasons existed for Ujagar Singh to state falsely.\\nExtra judicial confessions are not usually considered with favour but that does not mean that such a confession coming from a person who has no reason to state falsely and to whom it is made in circumstances which tend to support his statement, should not be believed.\\nThe murder was committed in the month of June.\\nBoth on account of the temperature and on account of the culprit 's desire to wash of blood marks on his person, the appellant 's bathing in the Canal at that hour of the night cannot be said to be improbable.\\nIt is not stated by sub Inspector Kishan Singh, nor it is alleged that the appellant had on his person or on his clothes blood stains when he presented himself at the Police Station.\\nThis tends to support Ujagar Singh 's statement that the appellant had a bath in the Canal at that hour.\\nOf course, this consideration springs out of the supposition that the appellant did commit the murder.\\nThe fact that he had the sword which was stained with human blood, leads to such a supposition, even if the mere possession of a sword so stained be not sufficient to establish conclusively that the person who possessed it so shortly after the murder of a person with whom he had enmity, had committed the murder.\\nThe Canal runs beside Ujagar Singh 's field.\\nUjagar Singh was on the field for the purpose of watching it against the neel gais trespassing and grazing the crop.\\nIt is not therefore a matter of surprise that he wakes up and proceeds to the spot from where the splashing sound which, is supposed to be due to the wading of the neel gais, came.\\nOn reaching the Canal bank, he observes 209 the person bathing and naturally asks him what.\\nled him to have a bath at that hour at night.\\nTaken by surprise, it is not unlikely that the appellant should have made a statement that he had committed the murder of Sheo Sahai and was, thereafter, having a bath.\\nThere is no reason to think that the appellant would not make such a statement when the appellant himself proceeds to the Police Station and hands over the blood stained sword.\\nIt is no doubt unusual, as urged for the appellant, that a person who commits a murder in pursuance of an enmity arising out of minor disputes, would be feeling so justified in his conduct as to openly admit it to the first person he met and to go to the Police Station and report about it.\\nIt is always difficult to find reasons for a person 's acting in a certain manner.\\nIt may be that having blurted out the truth to Ujagar Singh, when taken by surprise, the appellant thought the best thing to be to proceed to the Police Station and report the matter there.\\nIt is true that Ujagar Singh did not rush to the village at once and convey the news of the murder of Sheo Sahai.\\nThe learned Sessions Judge has considered the criticism against such a conduct and has held that there were good reasons for Ujagar Singh 's not leaving his field whose crops he was watching against the neel gais.\\nWe agree with the view of the learned Sessions Judge and do not consider Ujagar Singh 's conduct of continuing to remain on his field during the night to be so improbable as to affect his veracity.\\nUjagar Singh went to the village at about 5 a.m., and them told the people of what he had been told by the appellant.\\nThis statement of his, is supported impliedly by Paley Singh, P.W. 2, who states that the Sub Inspector was not present when Ujagar Singh related to them the fact which had taken place at night and by Bishram Singh, P.W. 13, who 210 deposed that Ujagar Singh stated that Ram Singh was taking his bath at night in the Canal Distributory and had said that he had come after committing the murder of Sheo Sahai and that the appellant had then proceeded towards the police station.\\nWe are therefore of opinion that Ujagar Singh 's statement about the appellant 's confessing to him that he had murdered Sheo Sahai has been erroneously rejected by the High Court.\\nThe extra judicial confession of the appellant to Ujagar Singh finds ample support from the facts that the appellant did purchase a sword a day before, that very sword was found to be stained with human blood shortly after the murder and that sword was handed over by the appellant himself to the Police Officer at the Police Station.\\nThe evidence of the appellant 's having enmity with Sheo Sahai, the appellant 's conduct in purchasing a sword and delivering it stained with human blood to the Police and the appellant 's confession to Ujagar Singh, fully establish that the appellant did commit the murder of Sheo Sahai.\\nWe are therefore of opinion that he has been rightly convicted of the offence under section 302, I.P.C., and has been awarded the proper sentence.\\nWe therefore dismiss the appeal.\\nAppeal dismissed.</td>\n",

Tatachari, for the appellant, Janardan Sharma, for the resondents.\\nJanuary 29.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by WANCHOO.J.\\nThis is an appeal by special leave in an industrial matter.\\nThe brief facts necessary for present purposes are these.\\nThe appellant in a saw mill carrying on business in Kozihkode in 824 the State of Kerala.\\nOne Sankaran was in the employ of the appellant as a crosscutter.\\nIt is said that on June 21, 1958, Sankaran came drunk to they mill and abused the Engineer, the Secretary and others and threatened them with physical violence.\\nHe was caught hold of by other workmen and taken outside.\\nIt is said that he came again a short time later at 4 30 p.m. and abused the same persons again.\\nThereupon the appellant served a charge sheet on Sankaran on June 24, 1958 acting out the above facts and asked him to show cause why his services should not be terminated on account of his grave indiscipline and misconduct.\\nSankaran gave an explanation the same day denying the allegations of fact made against him, though he admitted that he had come to the mill at the relevant time for taking his wages for that week.\\nOn June 25, 1958 Sankaran was informed that in view of his denial, a departmental inquiry would be held and he was also placed under suspension pending inquiry.\\nThe same day Sankaran protested against his suspension and requested that in any case the departmental inquiry should be expedited.\\nAs no inquiry was held till July 2, 1958, Sankaran again wrote to the appellant to hold the inquiry as early as possible.\\nOn July 8, 1958, the appellant terminated the services of Sankaran under r. 18 (a) of the Standing Orders without holding any departmental inquiry and the order was communicated to Sankaran the same day.\\nIn that order the appellant informed Sankaran that the proposed inquiry, if conducted, would lead to further friction and deterioration in the rank and file of the employees in general and also that maintenance of discipline in the undertaking would be prejudiced if he was retained in the service of the appellant, and therefore it considered that no inquiry should be held.\\nA dispute was then raised by the union which was referred to the industrial tribunal for adjudication by the Government of Kerala in October 1958.\\nThe tribunal held that 825 something seemed to have happened on the afternoon of June 21, 1958 but there was no evidence to prove what had actually happened.\\nIt further held that the appellant had intended to take disciplinary action against the workman but subsequently departmental proceedings were dropped and action was taken under r. 18(a) of the Standing orders.\\nThe tribunal was of the view that this was a colourable exercise of the power given under r. 18(a) to the appellant and therefore its action could not be upheld as a bona fide exercise of the power conferred.\\nThe tribunal also pointed out that no attempt was made before it to defend the action taken under r. 18 (a) by proving the alleged misconduct.\\nTwo witnesses were produced before the tribunal in connection with the alleged misconduct, but the tribunal did not rely on them on the ground that the important witnesses, namely, the Engineer, the Secretary and other members of the staff whose evidence would have been of more value had not been produced and no explanation had been given why they were not produced.\\nThe tribunal therefore held that on the facts it could not come to the conclusion that Sankaran had come drunk to the mill and abused or attempted to assault either the Engineer or the Secretary or other officers.\\nIn the result the order of discharge was set aside and Sankaran was ordered to be reinstated.\\nThe appellant thereupon applied for special leave which was granted; and that is how the matter has come up before us.\\nThe main contention of the appellant is that it is entitled under r. 18 (a) of the Standing Orders to dispense with the service of any employee after complying with its terms.\\nRule 18 (a) is in these terms: \"When the management desires to determine the services of any permanent workmen 826 receiving 12 as.\\nor more as daily wages, otherwise than under rule 21, he shall be given 14 days notice or be paid 12 days wages.\\n\" It may be mentioned that r. 21 deals with case of misconduct and provides for dismissal or suspension for misconduct and in such a case the workman so suspended is not entitled to any wages during the period of suspension.\\nThe claim thus put forward on behalf of the appellant is that it is entitled under r. 18(a) of the Standing orders which is a term of contract between the appellant and its employees to dispense with the service of any employee at any time by just giving 14 days notice or paying 12 days wages.\\nWe are of opinion that this claim of the appellant cannot be accepted, and it is too late in the day for an employer to raise such a claim for it amounts to a claim \"to hire and fire\" an employee as the employer pleases and thus completely negatives security of service which has been secured to industrial employees through industrial adjudication for over a long period of time now.\\nAs far back as 1952, the Labour Appellate Tribunal had occasion to consider this matter relating to discharge by notice or in lieu thereof by payment of wages for a certain period without assigning any reason: (see Buckingham and Carnatic Co. Ltd. Etg.\\nvs Workers of the Company.\\netc.) (1).\\nIt was of opinion that even in a case of this kind the requirement of bona fides is essential and if the terminataton of service is a colourable exercise of the power or as a result of victimisation or unfair labour praction the industrial tribunal would have the jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination.\\nFurther it held that where the termination of service is capricious, arbitrary or unnecessarily harsh on the part of the employer judged by normal standards of a reasonable man that may be cogent evidence of victimisation or unfair labour practice.\\nThese observations 827 of the Labour Appellate Tribunal were approved by this Court in The Chartered Bank, Bombay vs The Chartered Bank Employees ' Union (1).\\nand Assam Oil Company vs Its Workmen (2).\\nTherefore if as in this case the employer wanted to take action for misconduct and then suddenly dropped the departmental proceedings which were intended to be held and decided to discharge the employee under r. 18 (a) of the Standing orders, it was clearly a colourable exercise of the power under that rule in as much as that rule was used to get rid of an employee instead of following the course of holding an inquiry for misconduct, notice for which had been given to the employee and for which a departmental inquiry was intended to be held.\\nThe reason given by the appellant in the order terminating the services of Sankaran of July 8, 1958, namely, that the proposed inquiry, if conducted, would lead to further friction and deterioration in the rank and file of the employees in general and also that maintenance of discipline in the undertaking would be prejudiced if Sankaran were retained in service, cannot be accepted at its face value; so that the necessity for an inquiry intended to be held for misconduct actually charged might be done away with.\\nIn any case even if the inquiry was not held by the appellant and action was taken under r. 18 (a) it is now well settled, in view of the decisions cited above, that the employer could defend the action under r. 18(a) by leading evidence before the tribunal to show that there was in fact misconduct and therefore the action taken under r. 18(a) was bona fide and was not colourable exercise of the power under that rule.\\nBut the tribunal has pointed out that the employer did not attempt to do so before it.\\nIt satisfied itself by producing two witnesses but withholding the important witnesses on this question.\\nIn the circumstances, if the tribunal did not accept the evidence of the two witnesses 828 who were produced it cannot be said to have gone wrong.\\nLearned counsel for the appellant however urges that the employer was empowered to take action under r. 18 (a) of the Standing orders and having taken action under that rule, there was nothing for it to justify before the tribunal.\\nWe have already said that this position cannot be accepted in industrial adjudication relating to termination of service of an employee and has not been accepted by industrial tribunals over a long course of years now and the view taken by industrial tribunals has been upheld by this Court in the two cases referred to above.\\nLearned counsel for the appellant, however, relies on the decision of this Court in Parshotam Lal Dhingra vs Union of India.\\n(1) That was however a case of a public servant and the considerations that apply to such a case are in our opinion entirely different.\\nStress was laid by the learned counsel on the observations at p. 862 where it was observed as follows: \"It is true that the misconduct, negligence inefficiency or other disqualification may be the motive or inducing factor which influences the Government to take action under the terms of the contract of employment or the specific service rule, nevertheless, if a right exists under the contract or the rule, to terminate the service, the motive operating on the mind of the Government is, as Chagla C. J. has said in Srinivas Ganesh vs Union of India (2) (supra), wholly irrelevant.\\nIt is urged that the same principle should be applied to industrial adjudication.\\nIt is enough to say that the position of government servants stands on an entirely different footing as compared to industrial employees.\\nArticles 310 and 311 of the Constitution apply to government servants and it is in the 829 light of those Articles read with the Rules framed under article 309 that questions relating to termination of service of government servants have to be considered.\\nNo such constitutional provisions have to be considered when one is dealing with industrial employees.\\nFurther an employer cannot now press his right purely on contract and say that under the contract he has unfettered right \"to hire and fire\" his employees.\\nThat right is now subject to industrial adjudication and even a power like that granted by r. 18 (a) of the Standing orders in this case, is subject to the scrutiny of industrial courts in the manner indicated above.\\nThe appellant therefore cannot rest its case merely on r. 18 (a) and say that having acted under that rule there is nothing more to be said and that the industrial court cannot inquire into the causes that led to the termination of service under r. 18 (a).\\nThe industrial court in our opinion has the right to inquire into the causes that might have led to termination of service even under a rule like 18(a) and if it is satisfied that the action taken under such a rule was a colourable exercise of power and was not bona fide or was a result of victimisation or unfair labour practice it would have jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination.\\nIn this case the tribunal held that the exercise of power was colourable and it cannot be said that view is incorrect.\\nThe appellant failed to satisfy the tribunal when the matter came before it for adjudication that the exercise of the power in this case was bona fide and was not colourable.\\nIt could have easily done so by producing satisfactory evidence; but it seems to have rested upon its right that no such justification was required and therefore having failed to justify its action must suffer the consequences.\\nLearned counsel for the appellant also drew our attention to another decision of this Court in 830 The Patna Electric Supply Co. Ltd. Patna vs Bali Rai(1).\\nThat case in our opinion has no application to the facts of this case because that case dealt with an application under section 33 of the Industrial Disputes Act while the present proceedings are under section 10 of the Act and the considerations which apply under section 33 are different in many respects from those which apply to an adjudication under section 10.\\nThe appeal therefore fails and is hereby dismissed with costs.\\nAppeal dismissed.</td>\n",
                            "      <td>Summary:\\nS, employed by the appellant as a cross cutter in the saw mill was asked to show cause why his services should not be terminated on account of grave indiscipline and misconduct and he denied the allegations of fact.\\nHe was thereafter informed about a department enquiry to be held against him and was suspended pending enquiry.\\nPurporting to act under r. 18(a) of the Standing Orders, the appellant terminated the services of S, without holding any departmental enquiry.\\nThe industrial tribunal to which the dispute was referred held, that action taken, after dropping the proposed departmental proceedings was not bonafide and was a colourable exercise of the powerconferred under r. 18(a) of the Standing order and since no attempt was made before it to defend such action by proving the alleged misconduct, it passed an order for reinstatement of S, The appellant contended that as the termination was strictly in accordance with the terms of contract under r. 18(a) of the Standing Orders, it was entitled to dispense 823 with the service of an employee at any time by first giving 14 days notice or, paying 12 days wages.\\n^ Held, that the employer 's decision to discharge the employee under r. 18(a) of the Standing Orders after dropping the enquiry intended to be held for misconduct was clearly a colourable exercise of the power, and an employer could not press his right purely on contract and say that under the contract he has unfettered right \"to hire and fire\" his employees, right was subject to industrial adjudication and even a power like that granted by r. 18(a) of the Standing orders in this case was subject to the scrutiny of industrial courts.\\nEven in a case of this kind the requirement of bona fides was essential and if the termination of service was a colourable exercise of power, or was a result of victimisation or unfair labour practice, the tribunal had jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination.\\nBuckingham and Carnatic Co.

Text: This case concerns the circumstances in which under EU law a finding in a judicial decision by an EU court is binding in later judicial proceedings.\\nThe EU principle of res judicata, which applies directly in a domestic court of a member state when dealing with a dispute falling within the scope of EU law, has a number of strands.\\nOne is known as relative res judicata and applies where a second action is brought between the same parties, dealing with the same subject matter and based on the same grounds as an earlier action.\\nHowever, this case concerns a distinct strand known as absolute res judicata or, to use its full Latin tag, res judicata erga omnes.\\nThis is intended to convey that, where the principle applies, a judicial decision is given dispositive effect which is binding not simply on the parties to the decision but on all the world.\\nIt is a principle of EU law which has been developed by the EU courts in recent decades in a specific context for a specific purpose which relates to the effective judicial control of EU institutions and the maintenance of the EU legal order.\\nIt concerns the binding scope of a judgment of the General Court of the European Union (the General Court) or the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) annulling a measure adopted by an EU institution.\\nIn addressing its scope and applicability it is therefore necessary to set to one side distinct notions of res judicata, issue estoppel and abuse of process as understood in common law jurisdictions.\\nThe factual background\\nThe appellants (referred to collectively as Servier), who are defendants in each of the proceedings giving rise to this appeal, developed and manufactured the medicinal product perindopril erbumine (Perindopril), which is used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases including the treatment of high blood pressure.\\nThey marketed Perindopril under the trade name Coversyl.\\nPerindopril falls within the class of medicines known as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors).\\nServier obtained a number of patents for Perindopril during the course of its development.\\nThe respondents to this appeal (referred to collectively as the claimants), are the national health authorities of England, Wales, and Scotland and Northern Ireland.\\nThey are the claimants in the national proceedings.\\nThe High Court has directed that the three sets of proceedings be jointly managed and be tried on the same occasion (Order of Henderson J dated 26 February 2016).\\nThe present appeal is against the order of the Court of Appeal dated 27 June 2019 that followed a one day hearing on 18 June 2019 ([2019] EWCA Civ 1096; [2020] Ch 193).\\nThat order dismissed Serviers appeal from the order of Roth J at first instance dated 17 April 2019, following a two day hearing on 6 7 March 2019 ([2019] EWHC 1004 (Ch); [2019] 5 CMLR 6).\\nThe national proceedings\\nThe national proceedings were commenced by the claimants between May 2011 and September 2012.\\nIn those proceedings, each of the claimants alleged: (1) breaches by Servier of article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and/or the Chapter 1 prohibition under the Competition Act 1998 (the 1998 Act), consisting in the conclusion of anticompetitive agreements between Servier and potential manufacturers and/or suppliers of generic Perindopril, under which the generic manufacturers/suppliers would stay out of the market in return for financial consideration; and (2) an abuse of a dominant position by Servier contrary to article 102 TFEU and/or the Chapter 2 prohibition under the 1998 Act consisting in: (a) the obtaining, defending and enforcing of an invalid patent through the provision of misleading information to patent authorities and/or courts; and (b) the adoption of an exclusionary strategy, designed to keep competitors off the market, by entering into anticompetitive agreements with generic manufacturers and/or suppliers (as above), and by purchasing rights to an alternative means of manufacturing Perindopril developed by a company known as Azad.\\nIn addition, the English claimants alone pleaded a further claim for the tort of causing loss by unlawful means, based on largely the same facts as the alleged patent abuse.\\nFollowing the striking out of that claim ([2019] EWCA Civ 1160; [2019] 3 WLR 938), the claims are essentially identical across all three sets of proceedings.\\nThe English claimants appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal to uphold the strike out of that cause of action is pending before the Supreme Court.\\nThe claimants allege that by reason of Serviers unlawful conduct, the entry of generic Perindopril onto the UK market was delayed, which caused the price of Perindopril to be higher than it otherwise would have been.\\nThe claimants allege that as a result they have suffered substantial financial loss through the higher prices they have paid for Serviers Perindopril product.\\nIn October 2016, Servier was granted permission by Henderson J to amend its pleadings to include defences to the effect that if liability and causation are established then the claimants damages should be reduced or extinguished (i) because the claimants failed to mitigate their losses, (ii) for contributory negligence or (iii) because the losses claimed are too remote: [2016] EWHC 2381 (Ch); [2016] 5 CMLR 25.\\nThese defences are described collectively and for convenience as the prescribing argument.\\nThe Commission proceedings\\nIn 2009 the European Commission (the Commission) commenced an investigation in case COMP/39.612 into whether Serviers conduct relating to Perindopril had the object or effect of hindering generic entry of Perindopril on European Economic Area (EEA) markets.\\nThe Commission granted interested party status to the English claimants for the purpose of the administrative stage of the proceedings.\\nThis entailed: (i) access to a confidential 16 page summary of the Statement of Objections but not access to any of the evidence, submissions or other documents on the Commissions file (after the Commission proceedings had concluded, access was granted to relevant documents from the Commissions file in the disclosure exercise in the national proceedings); (ii) the opportunity, which was taken, to make submissions in writing; and (iii) the opportunity, which was taken, to attend the oral hearing and make 30 minutes oral submissions.\\nThe other claimants did not request to be and were not interested parties in the proceedings before the Commission.\\nOn 9 July 2014, the Commission issued a decision finding that Servier contravened articles 101 and 102 TFEU and imposing fines (the Commission Decision).\\nThose aspects of the Commission Decision concerning article 102 are most relevant to the present appeal.\\nIn particular, in determining that Servier held a dominant position in a relevant market (an element of the finding of breach of article 102 TFEU), the Commission defined the relevant market as comprising only Perindopril and it rejected Serviers argument that it comprised, at least, all ACE inhibitors.\\nAfter obtaining disclosure of the Commission Decision on 9 March 2015, the claimants in all three sets of proceedings introduced amendments to their particulars of claim to rely on the Commission Decision, including in relation to the definition of the relevant market.\\nServiers Appeal against the Commission Decision and the General Court Judgment\\nOn 21 September 2014, Servier applied to the General Court in Case T 691/14 seeking the annulment of the Commission Decision.\\nServier relied on 17 pleas in support of its application, including the 14th plea which was summarised as follows: the Commission wrongly and artificially restricted the relevant market for finished products to the single molecule of perindopril, by excluding the 15 other enzyme conversion inhibitors available on the market.\\nThe claimants did not apply to intervene and they were not involved in the General Court proceedings.\\nThe General Court gave its judgment on 12 December 2018 (Case T 691/14) EU:T:2018:922 (the General Court Judgment).\\nIn it, the General Court: (1) annulled one of the findings of infringement of article 101 TFEU (in relation to the settlement agreement between Krka (Krka Tovarna Zdravil dd is a Slovenian pharmaceutical company which had, with a number of other pharmaceutical companies, filed opposition proceedings before the European Patent Office against one of Serviers patents) and Servier), but upheld the remainder of the Commissions findings of infringement of article 101 TFEU; and (2) annulled the finding of infringement of article 102 TFEU in its entirety, on the grounds that the relevant market at the relevant time extended beyond Perindopril and Servier did not have a dominant position in that wider market.\\nBoth the Commission and Servier have now appealed from the General Court Judgment to the CJEU: see pending cases C 201/19P and C 176/19P.\\nThe UK Government has been granted permission to intervene in those appeals.\\nThe Commission is challenging (i) the General Courts approach to market definition including the General Courts analysis of the considerations of therapeutic substitutability and (ii) the determination that the Krka Agreement was not in breach of article 101 TFEU.\\nThere are significant overlaps between the allegations of infringement in the national proceedings and the infringements investigated and found by the Commission.\\nAs a result, it is common ground that the domestic proceedings cannot proceed to a final trial until the Commission proceedings and appeals therefrom have been finally resolved at EU level.\\nThe prescribing argument\\nThe prescribing argument relies (inter alia) on factual contentions that (a) ACE inhibitors exert a class effect (meaning that all drugs in the class work in essentially the same way and produce essentially the same effects) and (b) that there was no clinical difference between Perindopril and alternative ACE inhibitors that should have been material to NHS prescribers choice between ACE inhibitors, or to the claimants decision as to whether to encourage switching to other ACE inhibitors already available in generic form.\\nOn the basis of those factual contentions, Servier pleads further that NHS prescribers could therefore prescribe these ACE inhibitors as an alternative to Perindopril and the claimants should therefore have taken all reasonable steps to encourage switching from the prescription of Perindopril to the prescription of cheaper alternative ACE inhibitors in generic form.\\nParagraph 83C of Serviers re re amended defence to the English claimants claim sets out the particular steps which Servier contends the claimants should have taken to encourage prescribers to prescribe cheaper alternative ACE inhibitors that, unlike Perindopril, were already available in generic form during the relevant period.\\nOn 31 January 2018, Roth J ordered that there should be a nine day trial of a set of preliminary issues in relation to the prescribing argument.\\nThe early determination of these issues was intended to be useful because it could eliminate or substantially reduce the costs of a disclosure exercise relating to the prescribing argument.\\nOn 8 November 2018, the trial estimate for the preliminary issues was extended to 22 days and the trial was relisted for October 2019.\\nRoth J indicated that the preliminary issues trial should not take place before the General Court had issued its judgment, which it had not yet done at that time.\\nThe preliminary issues ordered to be tried, as subsequently amended, were: (1) Would it have been reasonable or appropriate in the period between 2003 and 2009 for a clinician to prescribe another ACE inhibitor instead of Perindopril in all circumstances, except where the patient was allergic to or intolerant of all alternative ACE inhibitors? (2) inappropriate? If not, in what circumstances would that have been unreasonable or (3) Was it unreasonable for the claimants to fail to take any (and if so, which) of the steps set out in paragraph 83C of Serviers re re amended defence to the English claimants claim or identified in Serviers Further Information dated 29 September 2017?\\nThe General Court having delivered its judgment on 12 December 2018, Servier indicated that its position was that certain findings made by the General Court (in particular as to the substitutability of Perindopril with other ACE inhibitors) would be binding on the High Court in the trial of the preliminary issues.\\nOn 18 January 2019, Roth J directed the parties to serve pleadings on the question of the extent to which findings of fact made in the General Court Judgment that also arise for determination in the preliminary issue trial of the prescribing argument are binding in that trial.\\nOn 1 February 2019, Servier served its pleading setting out eight propositions of fact derived from the General Court Judgment on which it intended to rely as binding in the trial of the preliminary issues.\\nThese propositions were: (1) There was no significant difference between Perindopril and other ACE inhibitors in therapeutic terms, including in terms of efficacy and side effects, mode of action, main indications and contra indications (General Court Judgment paras 1425, 1429, 1481, 1519, 1589). (2) ACE inhibitors were widely perceived as substitutable by prescribers and there were many medications considered by physicians as therapeutic equivalents to Perindopril (General Court Judgment paras 1481, 1489). (3) There were no reasons why physicians should not have prescribed ACE inhibitors other than Perindopril for new patients (General Court Judgment para 1489). (4) Switching between ACE inhibitors for existing patients did not raise particular fears on the part of physicians (General Court Judgment para 1519). (5) The prescribing behaviour of physicians was not characterised by a high degree of inertia and treatment changes in patients undergoing continuous treatment were significant (General Court Judgment para 1544). (6) At least some Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) considered, as from 2005, that Perindopril was no more effective than any other ACE inhibitor and recommended, for cost reasons, the use of other ACE inhibitors than Perindopril, or even the substitution of another ACE inhibitor for Perindopril, in particular lisinopril or ramipril (General Court Judgment para 1464). (7) At least some PCT policies had a real negative effect on Perindopril sales at local level (General Court Judgment para 1534). (8) Serviers promotional activities did not sufficiently differentiate Perindopril from other ACE inhibitors for it to be recognised for particular therapeutic qualities by physicians (General Court Judgment paras 1472, 1473).\\nServier contended that in so far as those propositions were findings made in the General Court Judgment, they were binding in the preliminary trial for two reasons: (1) the EU law principle of res judicata renders findings of fact and law constituting the ratio of an annulling judgment of the General Court binding erga omnes with absolute effect; and (2) in all of the circumstances of the case, including the claimants ability to participate in the EU proceedings (through the UK state) and their own positive reliance on the Commissions findings in relation to the prescribing argument, it would be an abuse of process for the claimants to require Servier to relitigate those factual issues in the mitigation trial.\\nThe claimants admitted as facts the propositions stated at (6) and (7) in para 19 above, so the question of whether those findings were binding did not arise for consideration by Roth J.\\nThe claimants denied, however, that the principle of res judicata confers binding effect in respect of the other findings of fact relied on by Servier in these proceedings, and denied that there would be an abuse of process as alleged or at all.\\nIn his judgment Roth J addressed (at para 51) the question of whether the six disputed propositions were actually found as facts in the General Court Judgment.\\nHe concluded that: (1) propositions (1) to (3) were findings made in the General Court Judgment; (2) proposition (5) was only made in modified form, to the effect that the Commission had not established that the prescribing behaviour of physicians was characterised by a high degree of inertia, and treatment changes in patients undergoing continuous treatment were significant; and (3) propositions (4) and (8) were not findings made in the General Court Judgment.\\nIn his judgment, Roth J held that none of the findings of fact constituted res judicata for the purposes of the preliminary issues trial, and that it was not an abuse of process for the claimants to advance arguments and adduce evidence at the preliminary issues trial contrary to the propositions set out by Servier.\\nRoth J granted permission to appeal in respect of Serviers res judicata pleading on the grounds that the question of how the EU principle of res judicata applies in this context had not been decided before and raised an important issue on which Servier had a reasonable prospect of success.\\nIn addition, Servier sought permission first from Roth J, and then from the Court of Appeal, on the questions of (i) whether propositions (4), (5) and (8) had been found as facts in the General Court Judgment, and (ii) on the question of abuse of process.\\nPermission to appeal was refused on these further grounds.\\nOn 18 June 2019, the Court of Appeal heard the expedited appeal from Roth J in relation to the issue of res judicata.\\nOn 27 June 2019 the Court of Appeal delivered its judgment ([2020] Ch 193), in which it held that none of the findings of fact relied on by Servier constituted res judicata for the purposes of the preliminary issues hearing.\\nIt refused permission to appeal to the Supreme Court.\\nOn 25 July 2019, the Supreme Court granted Servier permission to appeal on the issue of res judicata, solely on the basis that the application involved a point of law which is arguably not acte clair.\\nOn 26 July 2019, at the pre trial review in relation to the preliminary issues hearing, with the consent of the parties, Roth J vacated the October 2019 preliminary issues hearing pending determination of this appeal to the Supreme Court.\\nIssues on this appeal\\nOn this appeal, the Supreme Court is asked to determine whether the following findings of fact made by the General Court are binding on the national court in a trial of preliminary issues under the EU principle of res judicata: the finding that there was no significant difference between (1) Perindopril and other ACE inhibitors in therapeutic terms, including in terms of efficacy and side effects, mode of action, main indications and contra indications (paras 1425, 1429, 1481, 1519 and 1589 of the General Court Judgment); the finding that ACE inhibitors were widely perceived as substitutable (2) by prescribers and there were many medications considered by physicians as therapeutic equivalents to Perindopril: (paras 1481 and 1489 of the General Court Judgment); (3) the finding that there was no element that limited the discretion available to physicians to prescribe ACE inhibitors other than Perindopril for new patients (para 1489 of the General Court Judgment); and the findings: (i) that the Commission had not established that the (4) prescribing behaviour of physicians was characterised by a high degree of inertia; and (ii) treatment changes in patients undergoing continuous treatment were significant (paras 1540 and 1544 of the General Court Judgment).\\nServier contends that the appeal raises a point of EU law that cannot be characterised as acte clair against Servier.\\nBy contrast, the claimants contend that the point of law is acte clair and that the High Court and Court of Appeal reached the right conclusion.\\nIf the Supreme Court agrees with Servier that this issue is not acte clair against it, the Supreme Court is asked to refer</td>\n",
                            "      <td>Summary:\\nIn this appeal, the Supreme Court is asked to decide whether findings of fact made by the General Court of the European Union (the General Court) are binding in subsequent domestic proceedings, under the EU principle of absolute res judicata.\\nThe appellants (collectively known as Servier), developed and manufactured the drug Perindopril, which is used to treat cardiovascular diseases including high blood pressure.\\nPerindopril falls within the class of medicines known as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors).\\nThe respondents, who are the claimants in the domestic proceedings, are the national health authorities of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\\nBetween May 2011 and September 2012, the claimants issued proceedings in England and Wales which alleged that Servier had: (i) breached article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and/or Chapter 1 of the Competition Act 1998 (the 1998 Act) by entering into anticompetitive agreements with potential generic manufacturers and/or suppliers; and (ii) abused its dominant position in the market contrary to article 102 TFEU and/or Chapter 2 of the 1998 Act.\\nThe claimants contend that this allegedly unlawful conduct has delayed the entry of cheaper generic versions of Perindopril onto the UK market, which has, in turn, caused the claimants to suffer substantial financial loss.\\nServiers conduct relating to Perindopril was investigated by the European Commission (the Commission).\\nOn 9 July 2014, the Commission issued a decision which found that Servier had infringed articles 101 and 102 TFEU.\\nServier appealed to the General Court seeking the annulment of the Commissions decision.\\nThe General Court judgment upheld all but one of the Commissions findings of infringement of article 101 TFEU, but found that Servier had not infringed article 102 TFEU.\\nThis was because the relevant product market was not limited to Perindopril but extended to ACE inhibitors generally, and Servier did not have a dominant position in that wider market.\\nBoth the Commission and Servier have appealed to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).\\nAs there are significant overlaps, the domestic proceedings cannot proceed to a final trial until the EU proceedings have been resolved.\\nHowever, in October 2016, Servier was granted permission to plead that the claimants failed to take reasonable steps to encourage switching from the prescription of Perindopril to cheaper generic ACE inhibitors.\\nServier asserts that, even if liability and causation are established, the claimants damages should be reduced or extinguished: (i) because the claimants failed to mitigate their loss; (ii) for contributory negligence; and (iii) because the losses claimed are too remote.\\nIt was determined that there should be a trial of preliminary issues relating to this argument.\\nServier argued that certain findings in the General Court judgment in particular concerning the extent to which Perindopril can be substituted for other ACE inhibitors are binding on the domestic courts in the preliminary issues trial.\\nHowever, both the High Court and the Court of Appeal held that none of the findings relied on by Servier constituted res judicata for these purposes.\\nServier appealed to the Supreme Court.\\nIt claimed that the point of law is uncertain, not acte clair, and that the Supreme Court should therefore refer the question to the CJEU under article 267 TFEU.\\nThe Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Serviers appeal.\\nIt holds that the General Court findings Servier relies on are not binding in the domestic proceedings, and declines to make a reference to the CJEU.\\nLord Lloyd Jones gives the judgment, with which all members of the Court agree.\\nThe EU principle of absolute res judicata only applies to judicial decisions which have become definitive, either after all rights of appeal have been exhausted or after the time limits for exercising those appeal rights have expired.\\nThe General Courts findings are not yet definitive, and may never become definitive, because they may be reversed or rendered redundant in the appeal pending before the CJEU.\\nThe findings are not, therefore, binding in the domestic proceedings under the EU principle of absolute res judicata.\\nA reference to the CJEU is unnecessary to decide the issues in this case [31 32].\\nThe Court nevertheless sets out its views on the underlying issues of law, in the hope that they might assist at later stages of the domestic proceedings [32].\\nThe leading authority on the EU principle of absolute res judicata is P&amp;O European Ferries (Vizcaya) SA and Diputacin Foral de Vizcaya v Commission (Joined Cases C 442/03P and C 471/03P) [2006] ECR I 4845 [33 37].\\nThis explains that, where the EU courts have annulled a Commission decision on substantive as opposed to procedural grounds, the substance of that judgment becomes binding on all the world, not just on the parties.\\nThis ensures stability of legal relations, because it means that a matter which has been definitely settled by judicial decision cannot be referred to the courts by different parties for reconsideration [38].\\nThe purpose of the EU principle of absolute res judicata is to prevent the annulling judgment from being called into question in subsequent proceedings.\\nThis purpose provides the key to the principles scope and applicability [38, 42].\\nAbsolute res judicata gives dispositive effect to the judgment itself.\\nIt therefore extends to the essential reasons for the judgment (or ratio decidendi), not just to the outcome set out in the operative part [39 40].\\nOnly those aspects of the judgment which explain why the Commission decision has been annulled form part of the ratio decidendi, because those are the aspects which must be respected to prevent the annulling judgment from being called into question later on [42].\\nThe General Court judgment annuls the Commissions finding that Servier had infringed article 102 TFEU, on the basis that the Commission was wrong to conclude that the relevant product market was limited to Perindopril, as opposed to all ACE inhibitors.\\nThe General Court made a number of findings of fact in this regard, including those Servier relies on.\\nAccordingly, if the General Court judgment becomes definitive and it can be shown that the relevant findings were an essential basis of that judgment, it would not be possible to challenge those findings in later proceedings which sought to contradict the General Courts conclusions on the relevant product market within article 102 TFEU [46].\\nIt is not necessary to treat the General Courts findings as binding in any other legal context.\\nIf the CJEU upholds the General Court judgment that Servier did not infringe article 102 TFEU, the claimants will no longer pursue their article 102 claim.\\nIn any case, at present, the domestic proceedings do not concern the relevant product market for the purposes of that article.\\nInstead, Servier relies on the General Courts findings to support its defence based on mitigation of loss flowing from alleged anti competitive agreements contrary to article 101 TFEU.\\nThe General Courts findings cannot be detached from the authority of the annulling judgment and deployed in this wholly different context [48].\\nServier contends that the General Courts findings are binding in any EU law proceedings which raise the same factual issues [47].\\nThe Supreme Court rejects this argument because it is not supported by the EU or domestic case law [49 60].\\nThis is not surprising, because it would be inconsistent with the purpose of the principle of absolute res judicata [49].\\nServiers proposed approach also raises practical difficulties because it has no workable defined limits.\\nMore generally, if it is confined to the context of the consequences of an annulling judgment, the principle of absolute res judicata promotes legal certainty, the effective judicial control of EU institutions and the maintenance of the EU legal order.\\nHowever, once freed from this restriction, it could operate in way that is arbitrary and unjust, binding persons not party to the original dispute in a wholly different legal context in a way which would be inconsistent with the principles of a fair trial [61].\\nThe claimants claims in the domestic proceedings do not call into question or undermine the General Court judgment or its consequences in any way, nor do they contradict the General Courts decision as to what needs to be done to comply with EU law.\\nThe Supreme Court is therefore satisfied to the standard of acte clair that the EU principle of absolute res judicata does not apply [62].\\n\\nExplanation:\\n- amendments: amendments\\n- general: general\\n-

Text: This appeal is sensitive and important.\\nI regret that I have failed to contain this judgment within fewer than 78 paragraphs, plus 25 paragraphs of a schedule to it.\\nThe Court of Appeal has made a rare finding that the judges conduct of the trial was unfair towards one of the parties.\\nWhen made in respect of the conduct of any judge, however senior or junior, such a finding carries profound sensitivity.\\nOur duty is to appraise it with the utmost care; and, were we to uphold it, we would need to address the order made by the Court of Appeal in consequence of it.\\nBut there is a second dimension to the appeal to this court.\\nFor the Court of Appeal also based its decision upon its understanding of the effect of section 4 of the Defamation Act 2013 (the Act), entitled Publication on matter of public interest; and energetic criticisms are made to us in relation to its exposition of the effect of the section.\\nFor reasons which will become apparent, our own analysis of the section will not form part of our decision; but it is intended to be helpful nevertheless.\\nIt will be convenient to describe the appellants as the defendants; and the respondent as the claimant.\\nThe first defendant, Mr Malkiewicz, is the editor in chief of a Polish newspaper, entitled Nowy Czas (which means New Time) and owned by the second defendant, Czas Publishers Ltd. The third defendant, Mrs Bazarnik Malkiewicz, is an editor of the paper, a director of the second defendant and the wife of the first defendant.\\nAt the relevant time the paper was published eight times a year, both in hard copy and online, and it addresses issues of interest to the substantial Polish community in the UK, particularly in London.\\nThe claimant, Mr Serafin, now aged about 68, was born in Poland but has lived in England since 1984.\\nThe claimant sued the defendants for libel in respect of an article which they published about him in the newspaper in October 2015.\\nOver seven days in October and November 2017 Mr Justice Jay (the judge), sitting in the Queens Bench Division of the High Court, heard the claim.\\nThe claimant appeared in person before him, supported by a McKenzie friend.\\nSimon Burn Solicitors had been acting for him but came off the record shortly before the hearing.\\nIt appears, however, that, outside court, a degree of legal assistance was continuing to be provided to the claimant during the hearing, in particular in relation to the compilation of his closing submissions.\\nBut ranged against the claimant in court was Mr Metzer QC, by then instructed directly by the defendants rather than by the solicitors who had acted for them until shortly before the hearing.\\nBy a reserved judgment dated 24 November 2017, the judge explained why he had decided to dismiss the claim: [2017] EWHC 2992 (QB).\\nOn 8 December 2017 he made an order to that effect.\\nThe claimant appealed against it to the Court of Appeal.\\nOn 5 March 2019 Lewison, McCombe and Haddon Cave LJJ heard the appeal.\\nBy a judgment of the whole court dated 17 May 2019, they explained why they had decided to allow the appeal: [2019] EWCA Civ 852.\\nOn 21 June 2019 they made an order to that effect.\\nThey remitted the task of quantifying the claimants damages in respect of part or all of his claim to a judge of the Media and Communications List other than the judge.\\nThe defendants now appeal to this court against that order.\\nB. The Background\\nFollowing his arrival in England, the claimant set up business as a builder.\\nIn about 1989 he joined POSK, a substantial Polish social and cultural association, established as a charity, with premises in Hammersmith.\\nFor about 15 years until 2012 he sat on the General Council of POSK and between about 2003 and 2007 he was a senior member of its House Committee, which was responsible for all building work done at the premises.\\nDuring his membership of it there was refurbishment both of the entrance hall and of the basement, where a bar and caf, together called The Jazz Caf, were created.\\nBetween 2007 and 2012 the claimant was joint manager of The Jazz Caf and often served behind the bar.\\nIn 2008 the claimant set up a company, Polfood (UK) Ltd, with a view to its importing Polish foodstuffs and selling them wholesale to Polish groceries in England.\\nThe company needed working capital and the claimant persuaded Polish friends and acquaintances to buy shares in it or to lend money either to it or to him for transmission to it.\\nBut Polfood soon became insolvent.\\nIn 2011 the claimant was declared bankrupt.\\nIn 2012 he was discharged but only in consideration of his entry into a Bankruptcy Restrictions Undertaking, which was to endure for five years.\\nHe thereby apparently undertook not to be a director of a company without the courts permission, not to borrow more than 500 without disclosing the restriction and not to be a trustee of a charity.\\nKolbe House is the name of a charity which runs a substantial care home in Ealing.\\nIt provides care for elderly Polish people.\\nWhile it was trading, Polfood supplied bread and other foodstuffs to Kolbe House.\\nIn 2012 the claimant began again to supply it with bread.\\nIn 2013 he became the maintenance man and general factotum at Kolbe House; and he invoiced it for works of renovation done by him there.\\nThe Meanings of the Article\\nThe article, written of course in the Polish language, is entitled Bankruptcy need not be painful.\\nAt its foot is the name of the first defendant, whom the judge described as a Polish intellectual in the old school.\\nThe judge described the article as satirical, witty, allusive and intellectually sophisticated in style and tone.\\nThe claimant alleged that the words of the article had in effect 13 defamatory meanings (or, to use the word in the Act, imputations).\\nThe defendants responded that the words bore a common sting, which was that the claimant was a bankrupt and a serially untrustworthy man who, in order to satisfy his ambition and financially benefit himself and his family in Poland, took improper advantage of a number of people, including women.\\nThe judge disagreed that the words bore this common sting and held that he was therefore required to address whether the defendants were liable for each of the 13 meanings which, insofar as they admitted them, were as alleged by the claimant and which, insofar as they disputed those alleged by the claimant, were those which he found the article to have carried.\\nThe first meaning (M1) was that the claimant abused his position as house manager of POSK in order to award himself or his company profitable contracts for maintenance work at POSK, avoiding the proper procedure for obtaining approval for tenders for such contracts.\\nThe defendants appear to have contended that, if the article bore this meaning, it was not defamatory by reason of section 1(1) of the Act, which provides as follows: A statement is not defamatory unless its publication has caused or is likely to cause serious harm to the reputation of the claimant.\\nThe judge rejected the defendants contention.\\nHe proceeded, however, to consider an alternative contention of the defendants, namely that they had a defence under section 2(1) of the Act, which provides as follows: It is a defence to an action for defamation for the defendant to show that the imputation conveyed by the statement complained of is substantially true.\\nThe judge found that M1 had been shown to be substantially true.\\nThe second meaning (M2) was that the claimant purchased memberships of POSK for those whom he could rely upon to support his electoral aspirations.\\nThe judge found that, even if, which he doubted, the publication of a statement to this effect crossed the threshold of serious harm to reputation set by section 1 of the Act, M2 had been shown to be substantially true.\\nThe third meaning (M3) was that the claimant was not really single at all, or at the very least his personal circumstances in Poland were mysterious and that he exploited his supposed availability as a means of bringing him closer to women, over whom he exercised his charm.\\nAs in relation to the second meaning, the judge found that even if, which he doubted, the publication of a statement to this effect crossed the threshold of serious harm set by section 1 of the Act, M3 had been shown to be substantially true.\\nThe fourth meaning (M4) was that the claimant in the course of supplying alcohol for retail sale in POSKs Jazz Caf, dishonestly ensured that money taken from sales would by pass the cash register, in order to obtain unlawful and fraudulent profit from those sales.\\nThe judge found that the statement to this effect had been shown to be substantially true.\\nThe fifth meaning (M5) was that the claimant conned a number of women into investing their life savings into his food business by leading each woman to believe she was the only one and with promises of a good life together with him.\\nThe judge found that the statement to this effect had been shown to be substantially true.\\nThe sixth meaning (M6) was that the claimant having dishonestly persuaded investors in his food business to part with their life savings, stole their money for himself and transferred it to Poland to support a family construction project in Poland and to support his family there.\\nThe judge found that the statement to this effect had been shown to be substantially true.\\nThe seventh meaning (M7) was that the claimant defrauded his creditors and dishonestly circumvented the normal consequences of bankruptcy in order to retain for himself personal wealth, in the form of a BMW X5 car and real property that he pretended to sell, that should have been made available to satisfy the claims of his creditors.\\nThe judge found that the statement to this effect had been shown to be substantially true.\\nThe eighth meaning (M8) was that the claimant had profited or attempted to profit by selling out of date food to Kolbe House, a residential care home for elderly and vulnerable people, including those suffering from dementia.\\nThe judge found that the defendants had failed to show that the statement to this effect was substantially true.\\nThe ninth meaning (M9) was that the claimant by means of exploiting his charm and sway over the female manager of Kolbe House, inveigled himself into the highest levels of management at the home to the extent that he treated it as if it were his own personal property, including accessing at will the highly confidential records of the vulnerable residents despite having no legitimate reason to do so.\\nThe judge found that the defendants had failed to show that the statement to this effect was substantially true.\\nThe tenth meaning (M10) was that the claimant abused his position of trust at Kolbe House and callously diverted to himself funds that were needed for the care of the homes elderly and sick residents by securing for himself a contract for the major renovation of the bathrooms at the home, even though these renovations were completely unnecessary.\\nThe judge found that the defendants had failed to show that the statement to this effect was substantially true.\\nThere is inconsistency in the judges judgment about what he found to be the 11th meaning (M11).\\nBut it appears to have been that the claimant supplied to Kolbe House frozen milk and bread which was close to its sell by date from a source which he did not disclose.\\nThe judge found that the statement to this effect failed to cross the threshold of serious harm to reputation set by section 1 of the Act.\\nThe 12th meaning (M12) was that the claimant dishonestly concealed from the manager and trustees of Kolbe House his current status as an undischarged bankrupt in order to win their trust and also to obtain a building contract for the extension of the managers home.\\nThe judge rejected the assertion of the defendants that the statement to this effect failed to cross the threshold of serious harm to reputation set by section 1 of the Act and he proceeded to find that they had also failed to show that it was substantially true.\\nThe 13th meaning (M13) was that the claimant concealed his bankrupt status from Ealing Council [in relation to a planning application] in circumstances where he was obliged to reveal it.\\nThe judge found that the defendants had failed to show that the statement to this effect was substantially true.\\nIt follows that, by this stage of the judges judgment, the claimants cause of action had been rejected in relation to all the meanings apart from M8, M9, M10, M12 and M13.\\nThese five meanings all related, directly or indirectly, to Kolbe House.\\nThen, however, the judge turned to address a further defence raised by the defendants in relation to all 13 meanings, thus relevantly including the five meanings which had until that stage of his judgment survived as actionable.\\nThis was the defence under section 4 of the Act.\\nD. Public Interest\\nSection 4, entitled Publication on matter of public interest, is more conveniently set out in para 52 below.\\nMuch of the argument before the judge in relation to section 4 surrounded subsection (1)(b), namely whether the defendants could show, particularly in circumstances in which they had not invited the claimant to comment prior to publication on their intended allegations against him, that it was reasonable for them to have believed that publishing the statements was in the public interest.\\nIn the event the judge found that the defendants had indeed established a defence under section 4 in relation to all the allegations and thus, relevantly, to the five meanings of them which had until that stage survived as actionable.\\nThe judge added, however, that, even if the defence under section 4 had not been established, he would not have awarded damages (other, presumably, than nominal damages) in respect of those five meanings.\\nFor, so he explained, the claimants reputation had been sufficiently shot to pieces by the other statements in the article which had been shown to be substantially true.\\nSo the judge dismissed the claim.\\nThe Appeal to the Court of Appeal\\nFor his appeal the claimant re instructed Simon Burn Solicitors.\\nThe claimants grounds of appeal were (a) that the judge had been wrong to uphold the defence under section 4; (b) that there was no evidence on which he could have found that M4 was substantially true and that, without reference to that finding, he could not have found that the claimants reputation had been shot to pieces by reference only to the other imputations shown to have been substantially true; and that the judges conduct of the hearing had been unfair to the claimant. (c)\\nBefore the Court of Appeal Ms Marzec appeared for the claimant and, as before, Mr Metzer appeared for the defendants.\\nThe court chose to address the grounds of appeal in the order set out by the claimant.\\nIt held, first, at para 84 that the judge had been wrong to uphold the defence under section 4.\\nIt held, second, at para 99 that on the evidence before him he had not been entitled to find that M4 was substantially true and so it set that finding aside.\\nThen, suggesting that M4 had been the most serious imputation made against him, it proceeded at para 101 to uphold the claimants contention that it would not have been open to the judge to find that his reputation had been shot to pieces by reference only to the other imputations shown to have been substantially true.\\nAt that stage of the judgment and (as it said) on this basis, the Court of Appeal explained at para 102 that the claimant was entitled to damages in respect not only of M8, M9, M10, M12 and M13 but therefore also of M4.\\nThe Court of Appeal then addressed the claimants third ground of appeal, namely that the judges conduct of the hearing had been unfair to him.\\nThe court was furnished with substantial parts of the transcripts of the first four days of the hearing and with 16 short excerpts from them on which Ms Marzec particularly relied.\\nThe court concluded at para 114 that on numerous occasions the judge had appeared to descend into the arena, to cast off the mantle of impartiality, to take up the cudgels of cross examination and to use language which was threatening and bullying; and that its impression was of a judge who, if not partisan, had developed an animus towards the claimant.\\nIt observed at para 117 that it found his conduct all the more surprising in light of the fact that the claimant was appearing in person and that, although he spoke it well, English was not his first language.\\nIt added at para 118 that it was highly troubled by the judges criticisms of the claimants disclosure of particular documents in circumstances in which the defendants had at no time sought an order for their disclosure.\\nThe court concluded as follows at para 119: In our view, the judge not only seriously transgressed the core principle that a judge remains neutral during the evidence, but he also acted in a manner which was, at times, manifestly unfair and hostile to the claimant [W]e are driven to the conclusion that the nature, tenor and frequency of the judges interventions were such as to render this libel trial unfair.\\nWe, therefore, uphold [this] ground of appeal.\\nThe Court of Appeals Order F.\\nThe problem is that the Court of Appeal did not in its judgment proceed to address the consequences that should flow from its conclusion that the trial had been unfair.\\nIn particular it did not consider whether that conclusion should in any way displace its earlier conclusion, set out in para 31 above, about the relief to which the claimant was entitled.\\nAt the end of its judgment the court said only that the appeal should be allowed; and, apparently by email, it invited the parties to file written submissions in respect of the appropriate order to be made in the light of its judgment.\\nThe transcript of the hearing before the Court of Appeal shows that both parties had then reluctantly accepted, as apparently had the court, that, were it to conclude that the trial had been unfair, it would have no option but to order a retrial of the claim.\\nThe written submissions of the parties to the court following distribution of its judgment show only limited departure from that position.\\nThus the claimants basic contention was that the judgment no longer stands because the trial was unfair and that the claim should be remitted for determination by another judge.\\nBut the claimant qualified his contention by reference to two points: he argued that, in the light of the courts judgment, the pleas in the Defence under section 4 of the Act and, in relation to M4, that it was substantially true should both be struck out of it.\\nThe defendants agreed with the claimants basic contention that there should be a retrial; they argued that all issues that were alive on the statements of case at the trial should remain alive at the retrial save to the extent that the judgment of the Court of Appeal had finally determined them.\\nIn this latter regard they conceded, no doubt subject to their proposed appeal to our court, that the judgment had finally rejected their defence in relation to public interest and that it should be struck out of their Defence; but they disputed that the judgment had finally rejected their contention that M4 was substantially true.\\nthe following order: In the event, however, the Court of Appeal, without giving reasons, issued 1.\\nThere be judgment for the appellant. 2.\\nThe orders of Mr Justice Jay . be set aside. 5.\\nThe matter shall be remitted for an assessment of the quantum of the claimants damages only, by a Judge of the Media and Communications List [other than Jay J].\\nIt follows that the Court of Appeal did not order a retrial.\\nIt ordered a remittal limited to the assessment of damages.\\nAt the hearing before us we asked counsel on both sides what each understood the courts order to mean.\\nDid it mean, particularly in the light of the order for judgment for the claimant, that the liability of the defendants was established in relation to all the mean</td>\n",
                            "      <td>Summary:\\nThe respondent (the claimant) sued the appellants (the defendants) for libel in respect of an article which they published about him in Nowy Czas, a newspaper addressing issues of interest to the Polish community in the UK.\\nThe Court of Appeal found that the conduct of the trial by Mr Justice Jay (the judge) in the High Court had been unfair towards the claimant.\\nThe defendants appeal against that finding.\\nThey also challenge the Court of Appeals analysis of the effect of section 4 of the Defamation Act 2013 (the Act), which sets out the public interest defence to a defamation claim.\\nThe claimant was born in Poland but has lived in England since 1984.\\nIn about 1989 he joined POSK, a Polish social and cultural association and charity.\\nHe became joint manager of The Jazz Caf, a bar and caf at POSKs Hammersmith premises.\\nHe also worked at Kolbe House, a charity which runs a care home in Ealing.\\nThe article was published in October 2015.\\nThe claimant asserted that it had 13 separate defamatory meanings, including that he had abused his position at POSK to award himself or his company contracts for maintenance work there; had dishonestly obtained unlawful and fraudulent profit from sales at The Jazz Caf (this meaning is referred to as M4); and had diverted to himself funds needed for the care of Kolbe Houses residents by securing for himself a contract for unnecessary renovations.\\nThe claimant represented himself at the hearing before the judge.\\nThe judge found that all the articles meanings other than the five relating to Kolbe House were substantially true or, in one instance, had caused no serious harm to the claimants reputation.\\nBut he found that in relation to all 13 meanings the defendants had established a defence to the claim under section 4 of the Act: for, in his opinion, each of them was on a matter of public interest, and it was reasonable for the defendants to have believed that publishing them was in the public interest.\\nSo the judge dismissed the claim.\\nThe Court of Appeal allowed the claimants appeal.\\nIt held that the judge had been wrong to uphold the defence under section 4; that he had not been entitled to find that M4, which it described as the most serious of the allegations, was substantially true; and that the claimant was entitled to damages in respect of M4 and the meanings relating to Kolbe House.\\nLastly, after reviewing transcripts of the hearing, it held that the nature, tenor and frequency of the judges interventions were such as to render [the trial] unfair.\\nIt ordered that the quantification of damages be remitted to a judge other than Mr Justice Jay but did not order a full retrial.\\nThe defendants now appeal to the Supreme Court.\\nThe Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.\\nBut, in place of the Court of Appeals order that only the assessment of damages be remitted, the Court orders that the case be remitted for a full retrial.\\nLord Wilson gives the only judgment, with which the other Justices agree.\\nUnfair trial The Court of Appeal was correct to treat the claimants allegation as being that the trial had been unfair, not that the judge had given the appearance of bias against him.\\nFor it is far from clear that an informed and fair minded observer would consider that the judge had given that appearance [39].\\nThe authorities on an inquiry into the unfairness of a trial establish the following principles: a judges interventions should be as infrequent as possible during cross examination of witnesses, and he must remain above the fray and neutral while evidence is being elicited; the quality of the written judgment cannot render a trial fair in circumstances where the judges interventions at the hearing prejudiced the exploration of evidence; and where a transcript exists, it is not the present practice of higher courts to invite the judge to comment on the allegations, but the fact that he is unable to comment requires those courts to analyse the evidence with great care [40 45].\\nUnrepresented litigants are unlikely to be equipped to withstand judicial pressure and so the judge must temper his conduct accordingly [46].\\nThe factual analysis of the conduct of the trial is set out in the schedule to Lord Wilsons judgment [47].\\nIt is important to remember (among other things) that the excerpts from the transcript which are reproduced there were separated by long stretches of evidence in respect of which no criticism of the judge can be made.\\nBut the transcripts do nevertheless show that the judge directed a barrage of hostility towards the claimants case and towards the claimant himself acting in person.\\nIn doing so the judge used immoderate, ill tempered and at times offensive language.\\nThe Court is driven to uphold the Court of Appeals conclusion that the judge did not allow the claim to be properly presented; that therefore he could not fairly appraise it; and that the trial was unfair.\\nInstead of making allowance for the claimants being unrepresented, the judge harassed and intimidated him [48].\\nThe logical consequence of a conclusion that a trial was unfair is an order for a complete retrial.\\nSo it is hard to understand the Court of Appeals order that all the issues relating to the determination of whether the defendants were liable to the claimant had been concluded.\\nConscious that the justice system has failed both sides, the Court, with deep regret, must order a full retrial [49].\\nPublic interest defence The House of Lords decision in Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd [2001] 2 AC 127 established the existence at common law of a specific defence to a claim for defamation brought in relation to publication of a statement on a matter of public interest.\\nWhere the defamatory material concerned such a matter, the defendant had to show that it had met the standard of responsible journalism, measured by reference to a list of ten factors [53 56].\\nSection 4 of the Act replaced the Reynolds defence with a new defence which, on any view, draws on the principles in Reynolds and later cases [58, 68 69].\\nThe section 4 defence is available where the defendant reasonably believed that publishing the statement complained of was in the public interest (s.4(1)(b)) [52, 62].\\nIn assessing reasonableness, the Court must (among other things) have regard to all the circumstances of the case (s.4(2)) [52, 65]. factors was deliberately omitted from the section [62, 69].\\nThe Court of Appeal was wrong to state that the Reynolds defence and the section 4 defence are not materially different: for the elements of the two cannot be equated [68, 72].\\nIt was also inappropriate for the Court of Appeal to regard the Reynolds factors as a check list in the context of section 4 [69, 77].\\nFor these and other reasons, the new judge should determine whether the public interest defence is available to the defendants without reference to the Court of Appeals reasoning on section 4 [78].\\n\\nExplanation:\\n- amendments: amendments\\n- general: general\\n- authority: authority\\n- records: records</td>\n",

Text: This appeal is concerned with the obligations under the Equality Act 2010 of a charity which has been set up to provide housing in Stamford Hill in Hackney for a disadvantaged group, the observant Orthodox Jewish community comprising, in particular, the Haredi community.\\nThe charity is the second respondent, Agudas Israel Housing Association Ltd (AIHA).\\nIts charitable objective is to make social housing available primarily for members of the Orthodox Jewish community.\\nSuch is the surplus of demand for social housing from the members of that community, as compared with the properties which AIHA has available, that in practice all of AIHAs properties are allocated to members of the Orthodox Jewish community.\\nThe first respondent is a local housing authority, Hackney London Borough Council (the Council).\\nAIHA makes properties available to the Council, as they become vacant, to house persons who have applied to the Council for social housing and who have been identified by the Council as having a priority need for such housing.\\nThe properties provided by AIHA constitute about 1% of the stock of social housing available to the Council.\\nIn relation to the Council, there is a large surplus of demand for social housing as compared with the supply available, so applicants for social housing can spend long periods waiting for suitable properties to become available.\\nThe Council does not have any right to compel AIHA to take tenants who do not fall within the scope of AIHAs charitable objective and its selection criteria.\\nThe Council therefore nominates applicants for social housing with AIHA who fall within those criteria.\\nIn practice, this means that the Council only nominates members of the Orthodox Jewish community to be housed in property owned by AIHA.\\nThe principal appellant (the appellant) is a single mother with four small children: twin daughters and two sons, both of whom have autism and one of whom is also a party to the proceedings.\\nShe was on the Councils list for social housing and had been identified by the Council as having priority need to be housed in a larger property.\\nShe is not from the Orthodox Jewish community and so has been unable to gain access to the properties let by AIHA.\\nWhile the appellant was waiting to be allocated a suitable property by the Council, large properties owned by AIHA which would have been suitable for her became vacant and were allocated by AIHA to families from the Orthodox Jewish community who had also been identified by the Council as having priority needs.\\nThe appellant had to wait longer than them to be allocated a suitable property by the Council from its other social housing resources, as they became available.\\nThe appellant commenced proceedings against the Council and AIHA in 2018 complaining that this involved unlawful conduct on their part in various respects.\\nIn particular, she complains that there has been unlawful direct discrimination against her on grounds of her religion and on grounds of her race.\\nHer claim was dismissed by the Divisional Court (Lindblom LJ and Sir Kenneth Parker) in a judgment dated 4 February 2019: [2019] EWHC 139 (Admin); [2019] PTSR 985.\\nHer appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal (Lewison and King LJJ and Sir Stephen Richards) in a judgment dated 27 June 2019: [2019] EWCA Civ 1099; [2019] PTSR 2272.\\nIn the course of the proceedings, the appellants claims have been somewhat\\nrefined.\\nFor the purposes of the appeal to this court, the issues to be decided relate to the lawfulness of the conduct of AIHA.\\nThe Council accepts that if AIHA engaged in unlawful discrimination against the appellant by its allocation policy, then the Council cannot lawfully maintain its nomination arrangements with AIHA.\\nBut there is no distinct legal claim against the Council which does not turn upon the underlying substantive question of whether AIHA acted lawfully or not.\\nAccordingly, in what follows, the focus is entirely on the claims against AIHA.\\nThe relevant claims brought by the appellant against AIHA were based on the prohibition of direct discrimination on grounds of race or religion by any person in the provision of services, as contained in the Equality Act 2010 (the 2010 Act).\\nAIHA relied on defences set out in section 158 and section 193 of the 2010 Act.\\nSection 158 provides for an exemption from unlawfulness for positive action to address needs or disadvantages experienced by persons which are connected to a protected characteristic.\\nSection 193 provides an exemption for the activities of charities under defined conditions.\\nAIHA accepts that it distinguishes between applicants for its housing on the grounds of religion and that, subject to the statutory defences, this would constitute unlawful direct discrimination contrary to the relevant provisions of the 2010 Act.\\nAIHA denies that it discriminates between applicants on grounds of their race.\\nMr Ian Wise QC, for the appellant, in his skeleton argument for the hearing in the Divisional Court, indicated to the court that since discrimination on grounds of religion was admitted by AIHA, it might be unnecessary to decide if AIHA discriminated on grounds of race.\\nThe Divisional Court took Mr Wise at his word and focused its analysis on the appellants claim of unlawful discrimination on grounds of religion.\\nIt made no finding as to whether there was discrimination on grounds of race. (This is subject to one narrow point which the Divisional Court did deal with, which is no longer a live issue between the parties: the court dealt with a submission on the part of the appellant to the effect that AIHA was not entitled to rely on a defence under section 193 of the 2010 Act by reason of section 194(2) of that Act.\\nSection 194(2) provides that a charity may not avail itself of a defence under section 193 if it discriminates on grounds of race, in the sense of colour.\\nThe Divisional Court found that AIHA does not discriminate between applicants for housing on grounds of colour and by the time of the hearings in the Court of Appeal and in this court this was common ground.)\\nAlthough the Divisional Court had been invited by Mr Wise not to deal with the allegation of discrimination on grounds of race if it was unnecessary to do so and hence did not make findings about that part of the case, on the appellants appeal to the Court of Appeal this was made into a point of criticism.\\nFurther, for the first time in his reply skeleton argument in the Court of Appeal, Mr Wise referred to Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (the Race Directive).\\nAt that stage, the Race Directive was relied on as a potential aid to interpretation of section 193 of the 2010 Act.\\nThis was not on the footing that the appellant had rights under it as against AIHA on the findings made by the Divisional Court (which involved only discrimination on grounds of religion, which does not fall within the scope of the Race Directive), but on the basis that others might have rights under the Directive where there was discrimination on grounds of race and that these rights ought to be reflected in the interpretation of section 193, by virtue of the principle of sympathetic construction of national legislation articulated by the European Court of Justice (now the Court of Justice of the European Union: I will refer to it as the CJEU in both phases of its existence) in Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional De Alimentacion SA (Case C 106/89) [1990] ECR I 4135; [1992] 1 CMLR 305 (Marleasing).\\nThe Court of Appeal rejected this argument (para 54).\\nSince the appellant could not show that she had suffered discrimination on grounds of race within the scope of the Race Directive, she could not benefit from the special interpretive obligation arising from the Marleasing case.\\nSimilarly, since the appellant had not shown that her case fell within the scope of EU law, she could not rely on the right against discrimination set out in article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the CFR).\\nOn the appeal to this court, the appellants position shifted again.\\nAt the hearing, Mr Wise applied to the court for permission to introduce a new argument for the appellant.\\nAccording to this argument, Mr Wise invites the court to find that the appellant was in fact affected by direct discrimination by AIHA on grounds of race or ethnic origin, contrary to the Race Directive.\\nHe submits that the appellant was subject to direct discrimination on grounds of ethnic origin which was the same as that found by this court, by a majority, to have occurred in R (E) v Governing Body of JFS (United Synagogue intervening) [2009] UKSC 15; [2010] 2 AC 728 (JFS) in the context of the application of domestic anti discrimination legislation, and that this means that she must be taken to have been subjected to direct discrimination on grounds of race or ethnic origin for the purposes of the Race Directive.\\nOn that basis, Mr Wise submits that either section 193 must be read so as to be compatible with the appellants rights under the Race Directive in accordance with the Marleasing principle of sympathetic construction or, if that cannot be done, it should be disapplied altogether by virtue of the principle of direct effect of EU law.\\nIt is very unusual for this court to grant permission for a wholly new argument to be introduced at this stage.\\nMoreover, since it is a new argument based on a legal instrument (the Race Directive) which was not pleaded by the appellant in her grounds of claim, Mr Wise should have made an application to amend those grounds, which (if allowed) would also have led to AIHA and the Council having the right to amend their grounds of defence to meet the new claim.\\nAs it is, the court was not presented by Mr Wise with any formal or clear statement of the new claim which he wished to introduce.\\nThis was highly unsatisfactory.\\nIt only emerged from the answer given by Mr Wise to a question by the court during his submissions in reply that this new case for the appellant did not involve any complaint of indirect discrimination by AIHA on grounds of race or ethnic origin.\\nAlso, the court did not have the benefit of a formally pleaded defence to the appellants new claim based on the Race Directive, which meant that possible defences had to be explored in submissions without a clear and proper focus.\\nAlso, to state the obvious, the court did not have the benefit of an examination of the new claim and those defences by the lower courts.\\nFurthermore, the appellant should have made a formal application for permission to amend her grounds of claim and to raise the new argument in this court well in advance, rather than leaving it to be raised at the hearing, thereby taking up time which was set aside for the substantive arguments on the appeal.\\nDespite these points, however, Mr Sam Grodzinski QC for AIHA made no strong objection to the introduction of this new case for the appellant at this late stage.\\nHe was confident that he was in a position to meet it without difficulty.\\nMr Matt Hutchings QC for the Council likewise made no strong objection.\\nHaving regard to their position, the court gave provisional permission at the hearing for Mr Wise to develop the new case for the appellant.\\nThe court reserved its position as to the possibility of refusing permission if, after hearing how the argument was developed, it considered that it had been advanced in a way which was unfair to AIHA or the Council.\\nIn the event, given the narrow basis on which Mr Wise sought to develop the new claim based on the Race Directive, the court considers that it is appropriate to confirm the permission given provisionally at the hearing.\\nI will, therefore, address the appellants new claim based on the Race Directive along with her claim based on the 2010 Act.\\nTwo final matters should be mentioned in this introduction.\\nAlthough at an early stage in the proceedings AIHA disputed that it carries out functions which have a sufficient public element to make it amenable to judicial review, it now accepts that it does.\\nBut AIHA does not accept that it is a public authority by virtue of carrying out functions of a public nature within the meaning of section 6(3)(b) of the Human Rights Act 1998 (the HRA).\\nAccordingly, AIHA does not accept that it has any obligation arising under section 6(1) of the HRA to act compatibly with Convention rights of the appellant or other applicants for housing.\\nIn her pleaded case and in her submissions in the Divisional Court and in the Court of Appeal, the appellant did not assert any claim against AIHA under section 6(1) of the HRA on the basis that it was a public authority within the meaning of that Act, and no such issue was included in the agreed Statement of Facts and Issues for the appeal.\\nIn his printed case for the appeal in this court, Mr Wise did include an argument to that effect.\\nHowever, in the event he did not make any application for permission to introduce it, so it is not necessary to say anything about it.\\nThe EU legislative context\\nThe Race Directive enshrines the principle of equal treatment, described in article 2 as meaning that there shall be no direct or indirect discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin.\\nArticle 3 provides that the Directive applies to to all persons, as regards both the public and private sectors in relation to a number of matters, including at article 3(1)(h): access to and supply of goods and services which are available to the public, including housing.\\nRecital (17) to the Race Directive states: The prohibition of discrimination should be without prejudice to the maintenance or adoption of measures intended to prevent or compensate for disadvantages suffered by a group of persons of a particular racial or ethnic origin, and such measures may permit organisations of persons of a particular racial or ethnic origin where their main object is the promotion of the special needs of those persons.\\nArticle 5 makes provision to allow for the objective set out in recital (17), as follows: With a view to ensuring full equality in practice, the principle of equal treatment shall not prevent any member state from maintaining or adopting specific measures to prevent or compensate for disadvantages linked to racial or ethnic origin.\\nArticle 21 of the CFR prohibits any discrimination based on a number of grounds, including race, colour, ethnic or social origin and religion or belief.\\nArticle 51 of the CFR states that it applies to member states only when they are implementing Union law.\\nThe domestic legislative context\\nThe 2010 Act makes various forms of discrimination unlawful.\\nDirect discrimination is defined by section 13(1) of the Act: A person (A) discriminates against another (B) if, because of a protected characteristic, A treats B less favourably than A treats or would treat others.\\nThe relevant protected characteristics are set out in section 4.\\nThey include race and religion or belief.\\nThe meaning of these concepts is explained in sections 9 and 10, respectively.\\nRace includes colour, nationality and ethnic or national origins.\\nBy contrast with the position in relation to indirect discrimination (defined in section 19 of the 2010 Act), there is no general defence of justification in relation to direct discrimination on the basis of these protected characteristics; but so far as is relevant for present purposes, particular defences are set out in sections 158 and 193.\\nService providers and persons exercising public functions are prohibited from discriminating, whether directly or indirectly: section 29.\\nSection 158 is headed Positive action: general.\\nSo far as relevant, it provides: (1) This section applies if a person (P) reasonably thinks that (a) persons who share a protected characteristic suffer a disadvantage connected to the characteristic, (b) persons who share a protected characteristic have needs that are different from the needs of persons who do not share it, or (c) participation in an activity by persons who share a protected characteristic is disproportionately low. (2) This Act does not prohibit P from taking any action which is a proportionate means of achieving the aim of (a) enabling or encouraging persons who share the protected characteristic to overcome or minimise that disadvantage, (b) meeting those needs, or (c) enabling or encouraging persons who share the protected characteristic to participate in that activity. (4) This section does not apply to (a) action within section 159(3)\\nSection 159 is headed Positive action: recruitment and promotion.\\nIt provides a defence where action is taken on the grounds of a protected characteristic to overcome disadvantages a person with that characteristic may face in obtaining employment or promotion.\\nSection 159(3) provides: That action is treating a person (A) more favourably in connection with recruitment or promotion than another person (B) because A has the protected characteristic but B does not.\\nSection 193 provides: (1) A person does not contravene this Act only by restricting the provision of benefits to persons who share a protected characteristic if the person acts in pursuance of a charitable (a) instrument, and the provision of the benefits is within subsection (b) (2). (2) The provision of benefits is within this subsection if it is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate (a) aim, or (b) for a disadvantage characteristic. for the purpose of preventing or compensating the protected linked\\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has the power to issue codes of guidance.\\nThe court must take any such code into account in any way in which it appears to the court to be relevant: section 15(4)(b) of the Equality Act 2006.\\nSection 3(1) of the HRA states that [s]o far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights.\\nThe Convention rights are those set out in the European Convention on Human Rights (the ECHR), as contained in Schedule 1 to the HRA.\\nThey include article 8 (right to respect for private and family life and the home), article 9 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion) and article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).\\nArticle 14 provides: The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\\nIn this case, AIHA relies on defences under section 158, section 193(2)(a) and section 193(2)(b) of the 2010 Act.\\nSuccess on any of these will mean that the appellants claim fails.\\nFactual background\\nThe Council is a local housing authority with statutory functions in relation to the allocation of social housing.\\nAs well as allocating its own stock of social housing, it also discharges its functions by nominating applicants for social housing to properties owned by independent housing associations such as AIHA.\\nThe Council assesses applications for social housing using a points based system which is based on need.\\nAIHA is a charitable housing association, established in 1986.\\nIn order to qualify as a charity, its activities must be for the public benefit: see section 4 of the Charities Act 2011 (the Charities Act).\\nIt is registered with the Regulator of Social Housing of England as a private registered provider of social housing under Part 2 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008.\\nIt owns property in Hackney, principally in parts of the borough which are inhabited by members of the Orthodox Jewish community.\\nAIHAs charitable objects are set out in its rules, which state: A2 The Association is formed for the benefit of the community.\\nIts object shall be to carry on for the benefit of the community (and</td>\n",
                            "      <td>Summary:\\nThis appeal is about the application of anti discrimination law to charities, where they are established to provide benefits (in this case, social housing) for particular groups which are the subject of their charitable objectives.\\nThe relevant anti discrimination laws are contained in the Equality Act 2010 and Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 (the Race Directive).\\nThe charitable objective of Agudas Israel Housing Association Ltd (the Housing Charity) is to make social housing available primarily for members of the Orthodox Jewish community in Hackney, in particular the Haredi community.\\nIt makes properties available via an online portal operated by Hackney London Borough Council (the Council), which is open to applicants for social housing whom the Council has identified as having a priority need.\\nThe Council cannot compel the Housing Charity to take tenants who do not fall within scope of its charitable objective and its selection criteria.\\nThis, combined with a significant surplus of need for social housing on the part of the Orthodox Jewish community, means that in practice the Council only nominates and the Housing Charity only accepts members of that community for the Housing Charitys properties.\\nThe social housing provided by the Housing Charity makes up less than 1% of the social housing available in Hackney.\\nThe principal appellant (the appellant) is a single mother with four small children, two of whom have autism.\\nThe Council identified the appellant as having a priority need for social housing in a larger property, and she has now been housed by the Council in such a property.\\nHowever, she had to wait longer to be allocated suitable housing as she is not a member of the Orthodox Jewish community and so larger properties owned by the Housing Charity which became vacant were not available to her.\\nShe issued proceedings against the Council and the Housing Charity, alleging that she had thereby suffered unlawful direct discrimination on grounds of race or religion contrary to the Equality Act 2010.\\nThe Divisional Court dismissed the claim and the Court of Appeal dismissed her appeal.\\nThe appellant now appeals to this Court.\\nShe was given permission to add to her claim based on the Equality Act 2010 a new claim that the allocation policy of the Housing Charity contravened the Race Directive by unlawfully discriminating against her on the grounds of race or ethnic origin.\\nThe appeal turns on whether the Housing Charity acted unlawfully or not in restricting access to its stock of social housing.\\nThe Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.\\nLord Sales gives the main judgment (with which Lord Reed, Lord Kerr and Lord Kitchen agree).\\nLady Arden gives a concurring judgment.\\nEquality Act 2010 The Equality Act 2010 makes it unlawful to discriminate directly against any person on the basis of certain characteristics, known as protected characteristics.\\nThese include race and religion or belief [17] [18].\\nHowever, the Act sets out exemptions where certain actions will not be considered as unlawful direct discrimination.\\nSection 158 provides one such exemption where positive action addresses in a proportionate manner needs or disadvantages connected to a protected characteristic [19].\\nSection 193 sets out two further exemptions.\\nSection 193(2)(a) permits charities to restrict benefits to those with a protected characteristic if that restriction is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim and section 193(2)(b) permits charities to restrict benefits to those who share a protected characteristic if the restriction seeks to prevent or compensate for a disadvantage linked to the characteristic [21].\\nLord Sales upholds the lower courts findings that the Housing Charitys allocation policy is proportionate and lawful under sections 158 and 193(2)(a) of the Equality Act 2010.\\nA proportionality assessment first requires the identification of a legitimate aim and, secondly, consideration of whether the measures taken to promote that aim are proportionate, having regard to other interests at stake [65].\\nThe dispute in this case centres on what constitutes a legitimate aim [60] [72].\\nAs found by the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal, the legitimate aims here include the minimisation of disadvantages which are connected to the Haredi communitys religious identity and counteracting discrimination which they suffer, including in the private housing market, and the fulfilment of relevant needs which are particular to that community [66].\\nThe Housing Charity was entitled to adopt a clear and strict rule about who could and could not apply for its social housing, which meant that it was made available just for members of the Orthodox Jewish community, to ensure that its charitable activities were focused on that community, so that its activities did in fact fulfil its charitable objective to alleviate the problems of that community [76] [87].\\nLord Sales holds that the Divisional Court correctly considered the Housing Charitys allocation policy in the light of the applicable legal framework and, accordingly, was entitled to find it to be proportionate and lawful under these statutory exemptions.\\nLord Sales makes his own assessment of proportionality [76] [87], which is in agreement with that of the Divisional Court [73].\\nLord Sales holds that, in any event, the Court of Appeal was right to say that the Divisional Courts finding of proportionality could only be set aside if it had misdirected itself or reached a decision which was wrong.\\nApplying this approach, he holds that the Divisional Court had been entitled to make this finding, with the result that its decision should be upheld on appeal [74] [75].\\nIn her concurring judgment, Lady Arden emphasises that an appellate court should generally not make its own assessment of proportionality in such circumstances [120], and with this caveat she agrees with the judgment of Lord Sales [121].\\nAs regards the exemption in section 193(2)(b), the Court dismisses the argument for the appellants that the provision is subject to an implied proportionality requirement.\\nThere is no sound basis on which such a requirement could be read into the provision [97].\\nFirst, even on the assumption that the case is within the ambit of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the ECHR), on the right to respect for private and family life, so that Article 14 of the ECHR (non discrimination) is applicable, any proportionality requirement inherent in that provision is satisfied by the structure of section 193 itself; Parliament was entitled to create a clear rule applicable to charities in the interests of conserving their resources for use in fulfilling their charitable objectives, having regard, among other things, to the regulation of charities under the Charities Act 2011 to ensure they operate in the public interest and the wide margin of appreciation accorded to Parliament, as the body with democratic authority, in setting social and economic policy, including encouragement for giving to charity [97] [110].\\nSecondly, on the same assumption that the case falls within the ambit of Article 8 of the ECHR, even if the structure of section 193 itself did not satisfy any relevant proportionality standard, the drafting of the provision and the policy underlying it are so clear that it would not be possible to read into it an additional proportionality requirement [111] [115].\\nIn the circumstances, therefore, it is not necessary to resolve the question whether the case falls within the ambit of Article 8 of the ECHR and the Court prefers to leave that issue open [96, 116].\\nSection 193(2)(b) should be applied according to its express terms.\\nIt is common ground that, on this basis, the requirements of section 193(2)(b) are satisfied in this case [50].\\nEven if a proportionality\\nrequirement could be read into the provision, it follows from the decision regarding proportionality in relation to section 158 and section 193(2)(a) that it would have been satisfied [55, 88].\\nThe Race Directive The Race Directive provides that discrimination on grounds of race or ethnic origin must be unlawful, particularly in relation to housing [89].\\nThe Court finds that the Housing Charity is not in contravention of this directive for the simple reason that its allocation policy differentiates on the basis of religious observance and not race or ethnic origin [89] [90].\\n\\nExplanation:\\n- general: general\\n- authority: authority\\n- terms: term</td>\n",

Text: This case concerns the use in a criminal trial of evidence obtained by members of the public acting as so called paedophile hunter (PH) groups, and whether this is compatible with the accused persons rights under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the ECHR).\\nPH groups impersonate children online to lure persons into making inappropriate or sexualised communications with them over the internet, and then provide the material generated by such contact to the police.\\nArticle 8 provides: 1.\\nEveryone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 2.\\nThere shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\\nAn adult member of a PH group, acting as a decoy, created a fake profile on the Grindr dating application using a photograph of a boy aged about 13 years old as a lure to attract communications from persons with a sexual interest in children.\\nThe appellant entered into communication with the decoy, who stated in the course of exchanges first on Grindr and continued on the WhatsApp messaging platform that he was 13 years old.\\nIn the belief that the decoy was a child, the appellant sent him a picture of his erect penis.\\nThe appellant also sent him messages to arrange a meeting.\\nWhen the appellant arrived for the meeting, he was confronted by members of the decoys PH group who remained with him until the police arrived.\\nCopies of the appellants communications with the decoy were provided to the police.\\nThe respondent, as public prosecutor, charged the appellant with offences related to sexually motivated communications with a child: (i) an offence of attempting to cause an older child (ie a child who has attained the age of 13 years, but has not yet attained the age of 16 years) to look at a sexual image, for the purposes of obtaining sexual gratification (contrary to section 33 of the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009 the 2009 Act); (ii) an offence of attempting to communicate indecently with an older child (contrary to section 34 of the 2009 Act); and (iii) an offence of attempting to meet with a child for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity (contrary to section 1 of the Protection of Children and the Prevention of Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2005 the 2005 Act).\\nI will refer to these together as the charges.\\nIn each case, the charge was put in terms of an attempt to commit the offence, because the appellant believed the decoy was a child whereas he was in fact an adult.\\nAfter indictment on the charges in Glasgow Sheriff Court, the appellant lodged a preliminary minute objecting to the admissibility of the evidence sought to be relied upon by the respondent on the basis that it had been obtained by covert means without authorisation under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Scotland) Act 2000 (RIPSA).\\nThe appellant also lodged a minute objecting to the admissibility of the evidence provided by the PH group on the basis that it was obtained covertly without authorisation or reasonable suspicion of criminality in violation of his rights under article 8.\\nBy a ruling dated 30 July 2018, after a hearing conducted on the basis of agreed facts (as set out below), the Sheriff repelled the appellants objections to the admissibility of the evidence provided by the PH group.\\nLater, at a trial on 29 and 30 August 2018, the respondent led evidence from the decoy and two police officers.\\nThe appellant did not lead any evidence.\\nHe was convicted on each of the charges.\\nAt a later hearing, the appellant was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment on each charge, to be served consecutively.\\nHe was also made subject to the notification requirements of section 92(2) of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 for a period of ten years.\\nThe appellant appealed against his conviction to the High Court of Justiciary (the High Court).\\nHe contended that the Sheriff should have found that the evidence provided by the PH group was obtained in breach of the requirements of RIPSA, that his rights under article 8 in relation to respect for his private life and correspondence were violated by admission of that evidence and that the Sheriff should have excluded it.\\nThe appellants appeal was heard in conjunction with the appeal in another case, which is not relevant for present purposes.\\nBy an interlocutor dated 20 September 2019 the High Court (the Lord Justice General, Lord Brodie and Lord Malcolm) refused both appeals.\\nIt granted the appellant permission to appeal to this court in relation to certain compatibility issues.\\nThe appeal on the compatibility issues\\nArticle 8 is a Convention right for the purposes of the Human Rights Act 1998 (the HRA).\\nSection 6(1) of the HRA provides that [i]t is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right (this is subject to certain exceptions which are not relevant in this case).\\nA prosecuting authority is a public authority.\\nA court also is a public authority for these purposes: section 6(3)(a) of the HRA.\\nThe case comes before this court by way of an appeal on compatibility issues pursuant to section 288AA of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995.\\nSo far as is relevant for present purposes, a compatibility issue means a question, arising in criminal proceedings, as to whether a public authority has acted in a way which is made unlawful by section 6(1) of the HRA: see section 288AA(4), read with section 288ZA(2).\\nOn an appeal under section 288AA, the powers of the Supreme Court are exercisable only for the purpose of determining the compatibility issue (subsection (2)(a)); when it has determined the compatibility issue the Supreme Court must remit the proceedings to the High Court (subsection (3)).\\nAn appeal under section 288AA may be brought only with permission given by the High Court or by the Supreme Court (subsection (5)).\\nIn this case, the High Court has granted permission to appeal in relation to its determination in the criminal proceedings against the appellant of two compatibility issues, as follows: 1. whether, in respect of the type of communications used by the appellant and the PH group, article 8 rights may be interfered with by their use as evidence in a public prosecution of the appellant for a relevant offence; and 2. the extent to which the obligation on the state, to provide adequate protection for article 8 rights, is incompatible with the use by a public prosecutor of material supplied by PH groups in investigating and prosecuting crime.\\nAs should be clear, this is not a full appeal, but an appeal limited to these compatibility issues.\\nFactual background and the judgment of the High Court\\nIn his ruling on 30 July 2018 the Sheriff set out the agreed facts as follows: 2.\\nThe Crown witness, Paul Devine, is a volunteer with Groom Resisters Scotland, an organisation which aims to protect children by catching online predators.\\nThe organisation consists of decoys and hunters.\\nDecoys create fake online personas with a general appearance of being under the age of 16.\\nThey remain in character as someone aged less than 16 in all communications with the public.\\nIn the event of a member of the public having apparently engaged in a sexual conversation with a decoy, a face to face meeting will be arranged at which a hunter or hunters will be present, who will then record and film the member of the public, while confronting them regarding the persons prior communication with the decoy persona.\\nThis recording may also be made available on the internet live, so that interested parties can see the confrontation take place.\\nThe video will also be uploaded onto various websites in order that it may be viewed by others.\\nThe organisation makes contact with the police at or after the time of the confrontation.\\nThe sexual communications between the decoy and the member of the public concerned, as well as the recording/film, of that persons confrontation with the hunters or extracts therefrom, are disclosed to the police for investigation. 3.\\nGroom Resisters Scotland is one of several organisations deploying similar operating methods which operate in Scotland and other parts of the United Kingdom.\\nThe police are aware that there are a number of hunter organisations operating in Scotland and across the United Kingdom, and evidence obtained from those organisations has led to a number of criminal investigations and prosecutions.\\nIn the present case the crown witness Devine, acted as a 4. decoy.\\nGroom Resisters Scotland provided him with photographs of a boy aged approximately 13 years old and he created an online profile on an App named Grindr, a forum through which males apparently can arrange to meet one another, inter alia, for sexual purposes.\\nThe terms and conditions of that App specify that users must be aged 18 or over.\\nThere was communication between the witness Devine, as the decoy and the minuter [the appellant], wherein sexual images and sexual written communications were sent by the minuter to the decoy.\\nThe decoy shared fake personal details with the minuter, staying in character as a 13 year old boy.\\nDuring the course of communications with the minuter, the decoys Grindr account was blocked and could no longer be used.\\nThere was further communication between the decoy and the minuter on WhatsApp and ultimately, arrangements were made between the minuter and the decoy for them to meet in person.\\nThe decoy advised two of the hunters in Groom Resisters Scotland, namely Crown witnesses Carling and Constable of these arrangements.\\nThe Witnesses Carling and Constable then attended the meeting place at the arranged time and confronted the minuter, broadcasting the confrontation live on Facebook.\\nFilm of the confrontation has since been posted onto social media.\\nDuring the confrontation the police were contacted by Groom Resisters Scotland.\\nPolice officers attended during the ongoing confrontation between the minuter and the hunters and Groom Resisters Scotland subsequently provided the police with extracts of the communications between the minuter and the decoy and the minuter and the hunters.\\nThe High Court, in its judgment, referred to exchanges taking place in online chat rooms; but the parties agree that this was a slip.\\nAll the relevant exchanges took place in communications between the appellant and the decoy which were not shared with others.\\nThe exchanges using the WhatsApp messaging platform were protected by end to end encryption.\\nThe evidence led at trial confirmed the account given above.\\nThe appellant initially contacted the decoy on Grindr on 18 January 2018.\\nThe record of the communications between them provided by the PH group showed that from the initial point of contact by the appellant, sexually explicit questions and statements were sent by the appellant to the decoy, as were sexually explicit photographs, including, at the outset, a photograph of the appellant holding his erect penis, to which the decoy responded stating that he was 13.\\nOver the period to 31 January, when the meeting which was arranged by the appellant took place, sexual communications continued to be sent by the appellant to the decoy.\\nDuring that period the decoy remained in character as a 13 year old boy.\\nAll sexual communications came from the appellant.\\nThe decoy responded to the appellants messages, including answering questions posed of him about his sexuality.\\nThe appellant asked the decoy to delete the messages which the decoy agreed to do.\\nAfter some time, the appellant asked the decoy to move the conversation to WhatsApp and they swapped telephone numbers to enable this to happen.\\nEntrapment was not in issue in the case, so no examination of the law in relation to that topic is needed.\\nThe appellant complained that the circumstances of the case were such that authorisation was required to be obtained under RIPSA for the decoy to act as a covert human intelligence source within the meaning of that Act; that no such authorisation had been obtained; and that as a result the evidence of the decoy had been obtained unlawfully.\\nHowever, the Sheriff and the High Court held that RIPSA had no application in the circumstances of this case, since the decoy acted on his own initiative and not at the instigation of the police (paras 52 53 of the High Courts judgment).\\nThis part of the High Courts judgment is not a matter which affects the compatibility issues which this court has to decide.\\nThe Dean of Faculty, Mr Gordon Jackson QC, for the appellant, sought to raise the RIPSA issue at the hearing before us in order to develop an argument that the acquisition and use of the evidence of the communications between the appellant and the decoy were not in accordance with the law, as is required by article 8(2) where there is an interference with rights under article 8(1).\\nHowever, the compatibility issues to which the appeal relates do not turn on the application of article 8(2), but on the prior question of the extent and effect of the rights conferred by article 8(1).\\nThere was also some debate at the hearing in this court as to whether the appellant thought that the decoy was a child at the time he sent his first message to him.\\nThe Dean of Faculty claimed that the appellant only learned this later in the course of their exchanges.\\nHe emphasised that according to Grindrs terms a person can only have a profile on the site if they are 18 or over, and observed that people putting up profiles on dating sites do not always use true photographs of themselves.\\nThe Solicitor General for Scotland, Ms Alison Di Rollo QC, for the respondent, did not accept the Dean of Facultys claim.\\nShe pointed out that the profile photograph used by the decoy appeared to be of a child, that the standard terms of dating websites regarding age are not always observed by persons using those sites, and that the appellant was told by the decoy that he was 13 years old very early in the exchanges and expressed no surprise and was in no way deterred from continuing to send sexualized messages.\\nThis court is not in a position to resolve this issue of fact and it is not necessary to do so for the purposes of this appeal.\\nThe charges in the indictment related to communications across the period from 18 to 31 January 2018, without dividing up the communications more precisely in respect of their timing.\\nThe trial was conducted on that basis, without any need for findings to be made as to the appellants precise state of belief as to the age of the person with whom he was communicating at the outset of that period.\\nThe appellant did not give evidence about that.\\nNor did he make any submissions in the Sheriff Court or the High Court about this point, or suggest that it was a significant matter in relation to what are now the compatibility issues before this court.\\nAccordingly, it is appropriate to proceed on the footing that throughout the whole or substantially the whole of the course of the relevant communications between the appellant and the decoy, the appellant believed the decoy to be a child aged 13.\\nThe High Court noted that the ECHR, and article 8 in particular, is primarily concerned with the protection of the rights of individuals from interference by the state.\\nHowever, the High Court also observed (para 47) that, in addition to its prohibitive aspect, article 8 imposes a positive obligation on the state to provide a suitable framework within which an individuals article 8(1) rights are protected from interference by other private individuals, including employers, citing Kpke v Germany (2011) 53 EHRR SE 26 (p 249), para 41, and the judgment of the Third Section of the ECtHR in Ribalda v Spain CE:ECHR:2018:0109JUD000187413, para 54 (there is now a Grand Chamber judgment in this case, dated 17 October 2019, to which I refer below).\\nThe High Court held (para 48) that since the decoy acted on his own behalf as a private citizen and not at the instigation of the police or any other public authority, the gathering of the evidence of the communications by him was not a case of interference by the state with the appellants correspondence.\\nThe appellant had sent his messages to the decoy, who had received them and passed them on to the police: There was no surveillance or interception (AD v The Netherlands, European Commission on Human Rights [CE:ECHR:1994:0111DEC002196293] THE LAW at para 2 citing G, S and M v Austria (App no 9614/81), unreported, European Commission on Human Rights, 12 October 1983). [The appellant was] fully participating in the communications and [was] aware that they were reaching the intended recipient [].\\nThe messages had reached their destination and in due course they were handed to the police for the purposes of prosecuting a crime.\\nAs regards the appellants private life, the High Court was prepared to accept (para 49) that, at a general level, a persons internet chats fall within the broad ambit of article 8(1) (Garamukanwa v United Kingdom [2019] IRLR 853, ECtHR, para 22), but went on to say that given the lack of any longstanding pre existing relationship between the appellant and the person with whom he thought he was communicating, he had no reasonable expectation that the communications would remain confidential or private (Halford v United Kingdom (1997) 24 EHRR 523, para 45; Ribalda v Spain, judgment of the Third Section, para 57; Garamukanwa v United Kingdom, para 23).\\nThe appellant had voluntarily engaged in his communications on Grindr and WhatsApp with a person he believed to be a child, for sexual purposes.\\nBy the time the police were informed, the criminal activity had already been carried out.\\nThe court said (para 50) that even if there had been a reasonable expectation of privacy or confidentiality on the part of the appellant, the interference with the appellants right to respect for his private life would have been justified under article 8(2).\\nThere was no involvement of the state prior to the evidence of the communications being obtained; the evidence was delivered to the police for the purposes of prosecuting significant criminal activities; and the admission of the evidence of the communications to proof at trial would be subject to the common law rules of fairness.\\nThe activities of the decoy were subject to general legal constraints applicable to him as a private individual at common law and under the criminal law, and his actions were justifiable as being for legitimate purposes of the prevention of crime and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\\nThe court further observed (para 51) that even if there had been a violation of the appellants article 8 right to private life, it would not necessarily follow that the evidence of the communications provided by the decoy should have been excluded from admission to proof at trial.\\nThe question of exclusion or not of evidence gathered in breach of a persons rights under article 8 would depend upon whether it was possible to have a fair trial, on application of article 6 of the ECHR (right to a fair trial) and domestic law rules to safeguard the fairness of criminal proceedings.\\nIn the courts view, given the protections available under both these regimes, there was no unfairness in the criminal proceedings against the appellant arising from the admission of the evidence provided by the decoy.\\nDiscussion Issue (1): were article 8 rights interfered with by the use of the communications provided by the PH group as evidence in the public prosecution of the appellant?\\nThis issue is directed to consideration of the rights of the appellant under article 8(1) which are said to be relevant in the conte</td>\n",
                            "      <td>Summary:\\nThis appeal concerns the compatibility of the use in a criminal trial of evidence obtained by a so called paedophile hunter (PH) group with the accused persons rights under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the ECHR).\\nArticle 8 provides that everyone has the right to respect for his or her private life and correspondence.\\nPH groups impersonate children online to lure persons into inappropriate communications and provide the resulting material to the police.\\nAn adult member of a PH group, acting as a decoy, created a fake profile on a dating application using a photograph of a boy aged approximately 13 years old.\\nThe appellant entered into communication with the decoy, who stated that he was 13 years old.\\nThe appellant sent the decoy a sexual image and also arranged a meeting.\\nAt the meeting, the appellant was confronted by members of the PH group who remained with him until the police arrived.\\nCopies of the appellants communications with the decoy were provided to the police.\\nThe respondent, as public prosecutor, charged the appellant with attempts to commit: (i) the offence of attempting to cause an older child (i.e. a child between 13 and 16 years old) to look at a sexual image, for the purposes of obtaining sexual gratification, contrary to section 33 of the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009 (the 2009 Act); (ii) the offence of attempting to communicate indecently with an older child, contrary to section 34 of the 2009 Act; and (iii) the offence of attempting to meet with a child for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity, contrary to section 1 of the Protection of Children and the Prevention of Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2005 (together, the charges).\\nThe appellant objected to the admissibility of the evidence sought to be relied upon by the respondent on the basis that it was obtained covertly without authorisation under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Scotland) Act 2000 and without authorisation or reasonable suspicion of criminality in violation of his rights under article 8.\\nThese objections were dismissed and the appellant was convicted of the charges.\\nThe appellant appealed against his conviction to the High Court of Justiciary, which refused the appeal and granted the appellant permission to appeal to the Supreme Court on two compatibility issues, which arise in criminal proceedings over whether a public authority has acted in a way that is unlawful under section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998.\\nThe Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.\\nLord Sales gives the judgment, with which all members of the Court agree.\\nThe appellant appeals on two issues: (1) whether, in respect of the type of communications used by the appellant and the PH group, article 8 rights may be interfered with by their use as evidence in a public prosecution of the appellant for a relevant offence; and (2) the extent to which the obligation on the state, to provide adequate protection for article 8 rights, is incompatible with the use by a public prosecutor of material supplied by PH groups in investigating and prosecuting crime [11].\\nOn the first issue, the appellant submits that there was an interference with the appellants rights to respect for his private life and his correspondence under article 8(1), which required the respondent to show that such interference was justified under article 8(2) [26].\\nThe court holds that there was no interference with those rights at any stage because: (i) the nature of the communications rendered them incapable of being worthy of respect under article 8; and (ii) the appellant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the communications [29] [31].\\nIt is implicit in article 8(1) that the protected features of private life and correspondence must be capable of respect within the scheme of values the ECHR exists to protect and promote.\\nStates party to the ECHR have a special responsibility to protect children against sexual exploitation by adults [32] [33].\\nHere, in the absence of any state surveillance, and where the issue is the balance of the interests of a person engaging in such conduct and the children who are the recipients of the relevant communications, the reprehensible nature of the communications means they do not attract protection under article 8(1) [40].\\nThe interests of children have priority over any interest a paedophile could have in being allowed to engage in criminal conduct.\\nFurther, the prohibition of the abuse of rights in article 17 of the ECHR supports the conclusion that the criminal conduct at issue in this case is not capable of respect for the purposes of article 8(1) [41] [43].\\nAn important indication of whether the right to respect for private life and correspondence is engaged is whether the individual had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to those communications, which is an objective question [51] [55].\\nThe appellants communications were sent directly to the decoy.\\nThere was no prior relationship between the appellant and recipient from which an expectation of privacy might be said to arise.\\nRequests made by the appellant to the decoy to keep the communications private did not establish a relationship of confidentiality.\\nFurthermore, the appellant believed he was communicating with a 13 year old child, who it was foreseeable might share any worrying communications with an adult [56].\\nThe appellant may have enjoyed a reasonable expectation of privacy so far as the possibility of police surveillance or intrusion by the wider public are concerned, but not in relation to the recipient [58].\\nOnce the evidence had been passed on to the police, the appellant had no reasonable expectation that either the police or the respondent should treat them as confidential.\\nAgain, under the scheme of the ECHR, the effective prosecution of serious crimes committed in relation to children is part of the regime of deterrence a state must have in place [59].\\nOn the second issue, the state had no supervening positive obligation to protect the appellants interests that would prevent the respondent making use of the evidence to investigate or prosecute the crime.\\nOn the contrary, the relevant positive obligation on the respondent was to ensure that the criminal law could be applied effectively to deter sexual offences against children.\\nArticle 8 has the effect that the respondent should be entitled to, and might indeed be obliged to, make use of the evidence in bringing a prosecution against him [64].\\n\\nExplanation:\\n- general: general\\n- powers: power\\n- confidentiality: a non-lawyer\\n- authority: authority\\n- terms: term</td>\n",

                            "      <td>Summarize this legal case and explain any terms. Text: Where an international commercial contract contains an agreement to resolve disputes by arbitration, at least three systems of national law are engaged when a dispute occurs.\\nThey are: the law governing the substance of the dispute; the law governing the agreement to arbitrate; and the law governing the arbitration process.\\nThe law governing the substance of the dispute is generally the law applicable to the contract from which the dispute has arisen.\\nThe law governing the arbitration process (sometimes referred to as the curial law) is generally the law of the seat of the arbitration, which is usually the place chosen for the arbitration in the arbitration agreement.\\nThese two systems of law may differ from each other.\\nEach may also differ from the law which governs the validity and scope of the arbitration agreement.\\nThe central issue on this appeal concerns which system of national law governs the validity and scope of the arbitration agreement when the law applicable to the contract containing it differs from the law of the seat of the arbitration.\\nThis is an issue which has long divided courts and commentators, both in this country and internationally.\\nOn one side there are those who say that the law that governs a contract should generally also govern an arbitration agreement which, though separable, forms part of that contract.\\nOn the other side there are those who say that the law of the chosen seat of the arbitration should also generally govern the arbitration agreement.\\nThere have been Court of Appeal decisions falling on either side of this divide: Sulamrica Cia Nacional de Seguros SA v Enesa Engenharia SA [2012] EWCA Civ 638; [2013] 1 WLR 102 and C v D [2007] EWCA Civ 1282; [2008] Bus LR 843.\\nIn its judgment in the present case [2020] EWCA Civ 574, the Court of Appeal considered that the time has come to seek to impose some order and clarity on this area of the law (para 89) and held that, unless there has been an express choice of the law that is to govern the arbitration agreement, the general rule should be that the arbitration agreement is governed by the law of the seat, as a matter of implied choice, subject only to any particular features of the case demonstrating powerful reasons to the contrary (para 91).\\nOn this appeal the appellant argues that this conclusion is heterodox and wrong and that the correct approach is that, in the absence of strong indications to the contrary, a choice of law for the contract is a choice of that law to govern the arbitration agreement.\\nThe appellant contends that in the present case the parties have chosen Russian law to govern the construction contract between them and that the implication that they intended the arbitration agreement included in that contract to be governed by Russian law is not displaced by their choice of London as the seat of arbitration.\\nIf that issue is decided in its favour, the appellant goes on to argue that the Court of Appeal was wrong to grant an injunction to restrain it from pursuing proceedings in Russia in alleged breach of the arbitration agreement.\\nThe appellants case is that, because the arbitration agreement is governed by Russian law, the Russian courts are best placed to decide whether or not the arbitration agreement applies to the claim which the appellant has brought against the respondent in Russia and that, as a matter of comity or discretion, the English courts ought not to interfere with those proceedings by granting an anti suit injunction. II.\\nFactual background\\n(i) The construction contract\\nOn 1 February 2016 a power plant situated at Berezovskaya in Russia was severely damaged by fire.\\nThe appellant (Chubb Russia) is a Russian insurance company which had insured the owner of the power plant, a company now named PJSC Unipro (Unipro), against such damage.\\nChubb Russia is part of the Chubb Group, which is the worlds largest publicly traded property and casualty insurer.\\nThe company responsible for the design and construction of the power plant under a contract made with Unipro in May 2011 was a Russian company called CJSC Energoproekt.\\nThe respondent (Enka) was engaged by Energoproekt as one of many sub contractors involved in the construction project.\\nEnka is a global engineering and construction company incorporated and based in Turkey with a substantial presence and history of operations in Russia, amongst other countries.\\nThe contract between Energoproekt and Enka dated 27 June 2012 (the construction contract) is a substantial document running to 97 pages, with around 400 pages of attachments.\\nIt was executed in parallel Russian and English versions (though it provides that the Russian language version has precedence).\\nThe construction contract contains, in article 50, a dispute resolution clause in these terms: Resolution of disputes 50.1.\\nThe Parties undertake to make in good faith every reasonable effort to resolve any dispute or disagreement arising from or in connection with this Agreement (including disputes regarding validity of this agreement and the fact of its conclusion (hereinafter Dispute) by means of negotiations between themselves.\\nIn the event of the failure to resolve any Dispute pursuant to this article within 10 (ten) days from the date that either Party sends a Notification to the opposite Party containing an indication of the given Dispute (the given period may be extended by mutual consent of the Parties) any Party may, by giving written notice, cause the matter to be referred to a meeting between the senior managements of the Contractor and Customer (in the case of the Contractor senior management shall be understood as a member of the executive board or above, in the case of Customer, senior management shall be understood as general directors of their respective companies).\\nThe parties may invite the End Customer to such Senior Management Meeting.\\nSuch meeting shall be held within fourteen (14) calendar days following the giving of a notice.\\nIf the matter is not resolved within twenty (20) calendar days after the date of the notice referring the matter to appropriate higher management or such later date as may be unanimously agreed upon, the Dispute shall be referred to international arbitration as follows: the Dispute shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce, appointed in accordance with these Rules, language, and the Dispute shall be settled by three arbitrators the arbitration shall be conducted in the English the place of arbitration shall be London, England. in 50.2.\\nUnless otherwise explicitly stipulated this Agreement, the existence of any Dispute shall not give the Contractor the right to suspend Work. 50.3.\\nNot used. 50.4.\\nNot used. 50.5.\\nAll other documentation such as financial documentation and cover documents for it must be presented in Russian.\\nOn 21 May 2014 Energoproekt transferred its rights and obligations under the construction contract to Unipro pursuant to an assignment agreement made between Energoproekt, Unipro and Enka.\\nBy clause 7.5 of that agreement, the parties agreed that disputes between Unipro and Enka were to be finally and exclusively resolved by arbitration in accordance with the provisions of article 50.1 of the construction contract.\\nAfter the fire in February 2016 Chubb Russia paid 26.1 billion roubles (approximately US$400m) to Unipro under its property insurance policy and thereby became subrogated to any rights of Unipro to claim compensation from third parties for the damage caused by the fire.\\n(ii) The Russian proceedings\\nOn 25 May 2019 Chubb Russia filed a claim in the Moscow Arbitrazh (ie commercial) Court against Enka and ten other defendants whom it claimed were jointly liable for the damage caused by the fire.\\nChubb Russia was required by the Moscow court to provide further details of its claims, following which the claims were accepted by the court on 3 September 2019.\\nOn 17 September 2019 Enka filed a motion in the Russian proceedings to have Chubb Russias claim against it dismissed (or left without consideration) pursuant to article 148(5) of the Arbitrazh Procedure Code, which is intended to give effect to Russias obligations under article II(3) of the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards 1958 (the New York Convention) to refer to arbitration parties who have agreed to submit to arbitration a dispute of which a court of a contracting state is seized.\\nEnka argued that the claim against it fell within the scope of the arbitration agreement contained in article 50.1 of the construction contract and ought therefore to be resolved, not by the Russian courts, but by an arbitration conducted in accordance with that provision in London.\\nThe Moscow court decided to deal with Enkas motion at the same time as the merits of Chubb Russias claims at a hearing fixed for 22 January 2020.\\nFollowing that hearing, which continued on two later dates, on 18 March 2020 the judge in the Russian proceedings announced her decisions (a) not to grant Enkas motion to refer the claim against it to arbitration and (b) to dismiss Chubb Russias claims against all the defendants on the merits.\\nThe reasons for those decisions were given in a written judgment handed down on 6 May 2020.\\nChubb Russia and Enka have both filed appeals in the Russian proceedings (in relation to the decision on the merits and the decision to refuse Enkas application, respectively).\\n(iii) The English proceedings\\nMeanwhile, Enka had on 16 September 2019 brought an arbitration claim in the Commercial Court in London seeking an anti suit injunction to restrain Chubb Russia from further pursuing the Russian proceedings against Enka on the ground that this was a breach of the arbitration agreement in article 50.1 of the construction contract.\\nEnka also sought injunctions against other members of the Chubb Group said to be caught up in Chubb Russias breach of the arbitration agreement, namely Chubb UK Ltd, Chubb European Group SE (Chubb Europe) and the ultimate parent company of the Chubb Group which is incorporated in Switzerland.\\nOn 15 October 2019 Carr J declined to grant an interim anti suit injunction but gave directions for an expedited trial.\\nThe trial took place on 11 and 12 December 2019 before Andrew Baker J. He gave judgment on 20 December 2019, dismissing Enkas claims against all the defendants.\\nHis primary reason for doing so was that he considered the appropriate forum to decide whether Chubb Russias claim against Enka falls within the arbitration agreement to be the Moscow Arbitrazh Court and not the English Commercial Court.\\nEnka applied to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal from this decision as it applied to Chubb Russia (alone).\\nThe application was granted on 6 February 2020 and the appeal was heard on 7 and 8 April 2020.\\nOn 29 April 2020 the Court of Appeal (Flaux, Males and Popplewell LJJ) allowed Enkas appeal and issued an anti suit injunction restraining Chubb Russia from continuing the Russian proceedings.\\n(iv) The arbitration proceedings\\nOn 10 January 2020 Enka gave notice to Chubb Russia and Chubb Europe of a Dispute under article 50 of the construction contract.\\nThis was followed on 11 March 2020 by a request for arbitration filed with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in which Enka sought a declaration that Chubb Russias claims in the Russian court fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement and damages.\\nOn 22 May 2020 Chubb Russia and Chubb Europe filed their answer to the request for arbitration in which they challenged the jurisdiction of the arbitrators and denied that Enka is entitled to any of the relief claimed.\\nOn 12 June 2020 the ICC notified the parties of the appointment of Mr Michael Brindle QC as president of the arbitral tribunal.\\nThe other members of the tribunal are Lord Hoffmann, nominated by Enka, and Lord Mance, nominated by Chubb Russia and Chubb Europe (without prejudice to their objections to the jurisdiction of the tribunal).\\n(v) This appeal\\nOn 26 May 2020 Chubb Russia applied to the Supreme Court for permission to appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeal.\\nOn 5 June 2020 this court granted permission to appeal and also stayed the anti suit injunction upon Chubb Russia giving suitable undertakings to protect Enkas position pending the outcome of the appeal.\\nThe appeal was expedited and heard over two days on 27 and 28 July 2020.\\nIt is a striking feature of the English proceedings that the trial, the appeal to the Court of Appeal and the appeal to the Supreme Court have all been heard in just over seven months.\\nThis is a vivid demonstration of the speed with which the English courts can act when the urgency of a matter requires it. III.\\nThe English conflict of laws rules\\n(i) The Rome I Regulation\\nWhere a court of England and Wales has to decide which system of national law governs a contract, the court must normally apply the provisions of the Rome I Regulation (a shorthand for Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations).\\nBy article 1(1), the Rome I Regulation applies, in situations involving a conflict of laws, to contractual obligations in civil and commercial matters.\\nArticle 1(2)(e), however, excludes from its scope arbitration agreements and agreements on the choice of court.\\nPursuant to article 3, a contract to which the Rome I Regulation applies is governed by the law chosen by the parties, where the choice is made expressly or clearly demonstrated by the terms of the contract or the circumstances of the case.\\nIn determining whether the parties have made a choice of law, the court should adopt a broad Regulation based approach, not constrained by national rules of contractual interpretation: see eg Dicey, Morris &amp; Collins on The Conflict of Laws, 15th ed (2012), para 32 048.\\nArticle 4 contains rules for determining the law applicable to the contract to the extent that no such choice has been made.\\nArticle 4(1) sets out presumptions or prima facie rules that apply in relation to particular types of contract.\\nHowever, where it is clear from the circumstances of the case that the contract is manifestly more closely connected with another country, or where none of the prima facie rules applies, articles 4(3) and 4(4) respectively provide for the contract to be governed by the law of the country with which it is most closely connected.\\n(ii) The common law rules\\nBecause the Rome I Regulation does not apply to arbitration agreements, an English court which has to decide which system of law governs the validity, scope or interpretation of an arbitration agreement must apply the rules developed by the common law for determining the law governing contractual obligations.\\nThose rules are that a contract (or relevant part of it) is governed by: (i) the law expressly or impliedly chosen by the parties; or (ii) in the absence of such choice, the law with which it is most closely connected: see eg Dicey, Morris &amp; Collins on The Conflict of Laws, 15th ed (2012), rule 64(1).\\nIn view of the similarity between the common law rules and the rules provided by the Rome I Regulation, cases in which the two regimes would yield different results are likely to be rare.\\nBut in principle, where an English court has to determine which law governs an arbitration agreement incorporated in a contract, it is the common law rules alone which because of the exclusion of arbitration agreements from the scope of the Rome I Regulation by article 1(2)(e) the court must apply.\\n(iii) Party choice\\nThe starting point at common law (as under the Rome I Regulation) is that contracting parties are free to choose the system of law which is to govern their contract, provided only that their choice is not contrary to public policy.\\nThe court must therefore construe the contract to see whether the parties have agreed on a choice of law to govern it.\\nAs Lord Diplock explained in Cie Tunisienne de Navigation SA v Cie dArmement Maritime SA [1971] AC 572, 603: The first stage, therefore, when any question arises between parties to a contract as to the proper law applicable to it, is to determine whether the parties intended by their contract to exercise any choice at all and, if they did, to determine what was the system of law which they selected.\\nIn determining this the English court applies the ordinary rules of English law relating to the construction of contracts.\\nThe exclusion of arbitration agreements from the scope of the Rome I Regulation by article 1(2)(e) does not prevent an arbitration clause from being taken into consideration for the purposes of article 3 in determining whether there has been a choice of the law applicable to other parts of the contract, as noted in Giuliano and Lagarde, Council Report on the Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations (OJ EU No C 282 1) at p 12.\\nBy the same token, the fact that other parts of the contract are within the scope of the Rome I Regulation does not prevent them from being taken into consideration in determining in accordance with the English common law rules of construction whether the parties have agreed on a choice of law to govern the arbitration clause.\\nLike any question of contractual interpretation, this is a unitary exercise which requires the court to construe the contract, including the arbitration clause, as a whole.\\n(iv) Law of the forum\\nWhere an English court has to decide whether a contract which is said to be governed by a foreign system of law is valid, the court applies the putative applicable law, in other words the law which would govern the contract if it were validly concluded.\\nAt the prior stage, however, of determining what is the applicable law or putative applicable law of the contract, all the leading authorities proceed on the basis that it is English rules of law which apply, as stated by Lord Diplock in the passage quoted above.\\nIn the Tunisienne case, for example, a contract for the transport of oil in several shipments contained a provision (clause 13) that the contract shall be governed by the laws of the flag of the vessels carrying the goods .\\nThe first question which the House of Lords had to decide was whether, in the circumstances of the case which included the fact that vessels flying different flags were used to ship the oil, this clause conveyed a choice of French law to govern the contract, as the shipowners argued.\\nTo answer that question the House did not apply the rules of French law governing the interpretation of contracts, but (only) those of English law.\\nThe same approach was adopted in Whitworth Street Estates (Manchester) Ltd v James Miller &amp; Partners Ltd [1970] AC 583, where the House of Lords held that subsequent conduct of the parties could not be looked at to construe a contract in order to decide whether it was intended to be governed by English (rather than Scottish) law.\\nThe exclusion of subsequent conduct as an aid to interpretation is a consequence of the objective principle of interpretation in English law, which searches not for what the parties subjectively thought or intended the effect of their contract to be but for what reasonable people in their position would be understood to have meant by the language used.\\nAlthough in the Whitworth Street Estates case English law was one putative applicable law of the contract, there is no suggestion in the speeches that this was the basis for applying English principles of contractual interpretation.\\nIn our view, it is both consistent with authority and sound in principle to apply English law as the law of the forum to ascertain whether the parties have agreed on the law which is to govern their contract (and, if not, what law governs it in the absence of agreement).\\nTo apply any other law for this purpose would introduce an additional layer of complexity into the conflict of laws analysis without any clea</td>\n",
                            "      <td>Summary:\\nThe central issue on this appeal is how the governing law of an arbitration agreement is to be determined when the law applicable to the contract containing it differs from the law of the seat of the arbitration, the place chosen for the arbitration in the arbitration agreement.\\nOn 1 February 2016, a power plant in Russia was severely damaged by fire.\\nThe appellant Russian company (Chubb Russia) had insured the owner of the power plant (the owner) against such damage.\\nThe owner had entered into a contract with another company (the head contractor), in relation to construction work to be carried out at the plant.\\nIn turn, the head contractor engaged the respondent (Enka), a Turkish engineering company, as a sub contractor in the construction project.\\nThe contract made between the head contractor and Enka included an agreement that disputes would be determined through arbitration proceedings in London.\\nIn May 2014, the head contractor transferred its rights and obligations under the contract to the owner.\\nAfter the fire in February 2016, Chubb Russia paid an insurance claim by the owner and, by doing so, assumed any rights of the owner to claim compensation from third parties, including Enka, for damage caused be the fire.\\nIn May 2019, Chubb Russia brought a claim against Enka in Russia.\\nIn response, in September 2019 Enka brought an arbitration claim in the High Court in London arguing that, by proceeding in the Russian court, Chubb Russia was in breach of the arbitration agreement and seeking an anti suit injunction to restrain Chubb Russia from pursuing the Russian claim.\\nAt first instance, the High Court dismissed Enkas claim on the primary ground that the appropriate forum to determine to scope of the arbitration agreement was the Russian court.\\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeal overturned the judges decision.\\nIt held that, unless there has been an express choice of the law that is to govern the arbitration agreement, the general rule should be that the arbitration agreement is governed by the law of the seat, as a matter of implied choice; that there was no express choice of law in this case and that the arbitration agreement was therefore governed by English law; and that it was appropriate to grant an anti suit injunction to restrain Chubb Russia from pursuing the Russian claim.\\nChubb Russia appeals to the Supreme Court.\\nBy a majority the Supreme Court dismisses the appeal.\\nThe judgment is given by Lord Hamblen and Lord Leggatt with whom Lord Kerr agrees.\\nLord Burrows delivers a dissenting judgment, with which Lord Sales agrees.\\nLord Sales also gives his own judgment.\\nWhere an English court must decide which system of law governs an arbitration agreement, it should apply the English common law rules for resolving conflicts of laws rather that the provisions of the Rome I Regulation, as the latter excludes arbitration agreements from its scope [25] [28].\\nAccording to the common law rules, the law applicable to the arbitration agreement will be: (i) the law expressly or impliedly chosen by the parties; or (ii) in the absence of such choice, the system of law most closely connected to the arbitration agreement [27].\\nIn determining whether the parties have made a choice of law, the court should construe the arbitration agreement and the contract containing it by applying rules of contractual interpretation of English law as the law of the forum [29] [34].\\nWhere the parties have not specified the law applicable to the arbitration agreement, but they have chosen the law to govern the contract containing the arbitration agreement, this choice will generally apply to the arbitration agreement [43] [52].\\nThis general rule encourages legal certainty, consistency and coherence while avoiding complexity and artificiality [53].\\nThe Court of Appeal was wrong to find that there is a strong presumption that the parties have, by implication, chosen the law of the seat of the arbitration to govern the arbitration agreement [59] [64].\\nAny overlap between the law of the seat and that of the arbitration does not justify such a presumption [64] [94].\\nWhile a choice of seat can lead to such an inference in some cases, the content of the Arbitration Act 1996, particularly section 4(5), does not support such a general inference [73] [82].\\nWhere there is no express choice of law to govern the contract, a choice of the seat of the arbitration does not by itself justify an inference that the contract (or the arbitration agreement) is intended to be governed by the law of the seat [110] [117].\\nWhere the parties have made no choice of law to govern the arbitration agreement, either specifically or by choosing the law which is to govern the contract as a whole, the court must determine the law with which the arbitration agreement is most closely connected.\\nIn general, the arbitration agreement will be most closely connected with the law of the seat of arbitration. [118] [119].\\nThis default rule is supported by the following considerations: (i) the seat is where the arbitration is to be performed (legally, if not physically) [121] [124]; (ii) this approach maintains consistency with international law and legislative policy [125] [141]; (iii) this rule is likely to uphold the reasonable expectations of contracting parties who specify a location for the arbitration without choosing the law to govern the contract [142] [143]; and (iv) this approach provides legal certainty, allowing parties to predict easily which law the court will apply in the absence of choice [144].\\nThe majority holds that the contract in this case contains no choice of the law that is intended to govern the contract or the arbitration agreement within it.\\nIn these circumstances the validity and scope of the arbitration agreement is governed by the law of the chosen seat of arbitration, as the law with which the dispute resolution clause is most closely connected [171].\\nThe seat of the arbitration is London.\\nTherefore, the majority upholds the Court of Appeals conclusion that English law governs the arbitration agreement, albeit for different reasons [171].\\nChubb Russia does not dispute that, if the arbitration agreement is governed by English law, it was legitimate for the Court of Appeal to grant an anti suit injunction in this case. [173].\\nThe Supreme Court, however, affirms the Court of Appeals decision that, in principle, it makes no difference whether the arbitration agreement is governed by English or foreign law, as the inquiry in both cases remains the same: whether there been a breach of the agreement and, if so, whether it is just and convenient to grant an injunction to restrain that breach [178] [182].\\nWhile there may be circumstances in which it would be appropriate to await a decision of a foreign court before granting an injunction, deference to foreign courts should generally give way to upholding the importance of the parties bargain [183].\\nLord Burrows and Lord Sales agree with the majority that, if the parties have expressly or impliedly chosen the law of the contract, this choice applies to the arbitration agreement [266].\\nThey dissent on what the default position should be in the absence of such choice.\\nThey consider that it should be that the law with which the main contract is most closely connected governs the arbitration agreement, as this is the law with which in their view the arbitration agreement is also most closely connected [257].\\nThey also dissent on whether the parties have in this case chosen the law that is to govern the contract.\\nIn their view, the parties impliedly chose Russian law to govern the construction contract and also,\\ntherefore, the arbitration agreement [228].\\nThey agree with the majority that whether it is appropriate to grant an anti suit injunction does not depend on what law governs the arbitration agreement but only on whether pursuing the foreign proceedings is a breach of that agreement.\\nAs they conclude that Russian law governs the arbitration agreement, they would remit the question of whether there has been a breach of the arbitration agreement so as to justify the grant of an anti suit injunction to the Commercial Court.\\n\\nExplanation:\\n- general: general\\n- authority: authority\\n- applicable laws: law\\n- terms: term\\n- jurisdictions: jurisdictions</td>\n",

Text: Appeal No. 101 of 1959.\\nAppeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated November 8, 1957, of the Deputy Custodian General, Evacuee Property, Now Delhi Revision Petition No. 17 R/55 of 1955.\\nAchhru Ram and K. L. Mehta for the appellants.\\nB.K., Khanna and, T. M. Sen, for the respondent No. 1.\\nN.S. Bindra and A. G. Ratnaparkhi, for the respondents Nos.\\nMarch 15.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUDHOLKAR J.\\nThe appellants who are admittedly displaced persons from West Pakistan were granted quasi permanent allotment of 24 standard acres and 15 3/4 units in the village of Raikot in Ludhiana District in 1949.\\nTheir father Sardar Nand Singh who was 42 330 found entitled to quasi permanent allotment of 40 standard acres and 5 1/4 units of land was given quasipermanent allotment in another village named Humbran in the same district.\\nThe two villages are, however, 25 miles or so distant from each other.\\nNand Singh, therefore, made an application for consolidation of his lands with those of the appellants in the village Raikot.\\nDuring the pendency of this application he died and after his death, the, application was continued by the appellants.\\nThis application was rejected by the Assistant Custodian on July 23, 1951 on the ground that no land was available in the village Raikot.\\nA revision petition preferred by the appellants against the order of the Assistant Custodian was dismissed by the Additional Custodian on August 20, 1952.\\nOn October 7, 1952 the appellants preferred a revision application before the Custodian General.\\nDuring the pendency of the revision application the Additional Custodian for the State of Punjab cancelled the allotment of fourteen quasi permanent allottees of the village Karodian in the same district on the ground that these persons were entitled to allotment of suburban land a had been wrongly fitted in the village Karodian.\\nActing suo motu the Additional Custodian made an order on October 31, 1952 cancelling the order of allotment of land in the village Raikot made in favour of the appellants in the year 1949 and instead allotted to them land in Karodian in substitution of :,the lands at Raikot and of the lands allotted to their father.\\nThe land allotted was out of the land released upon the cancellation of allotment of lands in favour of the aforementioned 14 allottees.\\nThese fourteen allottees preferred an application for review of the order cancelling their allotment on the ground that this cancellation was a result of misapprehension of the actual facts and that they were not entitled to allotment of suburban lands at all.\\nThe appellants also preferred an application for review of the order cancelling their quasi permanent allotment in the village Raikot.\\nThe Additional Custodian for the State of Punjab recommended to the Custodian General the restoration 331 of the land to the 14 allottees which had been taken away from them by reason of cancellation of the allotment in their favour by the order dated October 31, 1952.\\nThe Additional Custodian admitted that these persons were not entitled to allotment of suburban land and that consequently their allotment had been wrongly made but referred the matter back to the Additional Custodian for decision.\\nThe application made by the appellants was kept pending till the decision of the application of the 14 allottees of Karodian.\\nThe Additional Custodian, however, dismissed the application on the ground that r. 14(6) of the Evacuee Property Rules which came into force on July 22, 1952, stood in the way of cancellation of the allotment in favour of the appellant.\\nOn December 17, 1954, the Deputy Custodian General, before whom these allottees had preferred an application for revision, revised the order of the Additional Custodian and restored to the 14 allottees of Karodian the land which had been originally allotted to them.\\nand allotment of which had been cancelled earlier.\\nAs a result of this order the allotment of Karodian land made in favour of the appellants automatically stood cancelled.\\nOn January 6, 1955, the appellants moved the Deputy Custodian General for calling up their review application and for revising the order of October 31, 1952 passed by the Additional Custodian cancelling the allotment of Raikot lands which had originally been made in their favour in the year 1949.\\nConsequent upon the cancellation of the appellants ' allotment of the Raikot land they were allotted to respondents 2 to 4.\\nThese persons were, therefore, impleaded as parties to the proceedings before the Deputy Custodian General.\\nBy the order dated November 8, 1957 the Deputy Custodian General dismissed the appellants ' application.\\nThe appellants have, therefore, come up to this Court by way of appeal with special leave.\\nThe ground on which the appellants ' application was rejected by the Deputy Custodian General was that his jurisdiction to revise the order has been 332 taken away by virtue of the provisions of , (44 of 1954) and the notification issued thereunder on March 24, 1955.\\nIn taking this view he has relied upon the decision in Bal Mukund vs The State of Punjab (1).\\nIn that case the Court has held that the powers of the Custodian General to deal with matters of this kind have been taken away by the , and that these powers now vest in another authority and that there is no provision for continuing the pro ceedings which had been commenced under the , but had not been concluded.\\nMr. Achhruram for the appellants challenged the correctness of this decision.\\nThere is no specific provision in this Act to the effect that after its commencement the jurisdiction of the various authorities created by the , to deal with the allotment or cancellation of allotment of evacuee property shall cease.\\nWhat is urged by Mr. Khanna on behalf of the Custodian General is that this is the effect of the provisions of sections 12(2) and 19 of the Act.\\nSection 12 of the 1954 Act empowers the Central Government to acquire evacuee property for rehabilitation of displaced persons by publishing in the official gazette a notification to the effect that it has decided to acquire such evacuee property in pursuance of this provision.\\nIt is common ground that by notification section R. 0. 697 dated March 24, 1955 the Central Government decided to acquire all evacuee property allotted to displaced persons by the Custodian under the \"Conditions\" contained in the notification of the Government of Punjab in the Department of Rehabilitation, No. 4892 6 dated July 8, 1949, except certain categories of property specified in the schedule.\\nThe Raikot lands were allotted to the appellants under the aforesaid notification of the Government of Punjab.\\nIt is not disputed on their behalf that they do not fall within any of the excepted categories of property, set out in the schedule.\\nSub section 2 of section 12 of the Act (1) I.L.R. 1957 Punj.\\n333 provides that on the publication of the notification under sub section 1 the right, title or interest of any evacuee in the property specified in the notification shall immediately stand extinguished and that property shall vest absolutely in the Central Government free from all encumbrances.\\nThe power of the Custodian under the , to allot any property to a person or to cancel an allotment existing in favour of a person rests on the fact that the property vests in him.\\nBut the consequence of the publication of the notification by the Central Government under section 12(1) of the with respect to any property or a class of property would be to divest the Custodian completely of his right in the property flowing from section 8 of the , and vest that property in the Central Government.\\nHe would, therefore, not be competent to deal with the property in any manner in the absence of any provision in either of these two enactments permitting him to do so.\\nNo provision was, however, pointed out to us in either of these Acts whereunder despite the Vesting of the property in the Central Government the Custodian was empowered to deal with it.\\nSub section\\n4 of section 12 of the 1954 Act provides that all evacuee property acquired under that section shall form part of the compensation pool.\\nUnder section 16(1) of this Act the Central Government is empowered to take such measures as it considers necessary or expedient for the custody, management and disposal of the compensation pool.\\nSub section\\n2 of section 16 empowers the Central Government to appoint such officers as it deems fit or to constitute such authority or corporation as it deems fit for the purpose of managing and disposing of the properties forming part of the compensation pool.\\nSection 19 of the Act provides that notwithstanding anything contained in any contract or any other law for the time being in force but subject to the rules that may be made under the Act the managing officer or managing corporation may cancel any allotment etc., under which any evacuee property acquired under the Act is held or 334 occupied by a person whether such allotment or lease was granted before or after the commencement of the Act.\\nThis provision thus confers the power to deal with evacuee property acquired under the Act only on a managing officer appointed or managing corporation constituted under the Act and makes no mention whatsoever of the Custodian appointed under the .\\nNo doubt, under section 10 of the the Custodian is empowered to manage evacuee property and in exercise of his power he will be competent to allot such property to any person or to cancel an allotment or lease made in favour of a person.\\nApart from the fact that subsequent to the issue of the notification under section 12(1) of the , the property would cease to be evacuee property, the aforesaid powers of the Custodian would be in conflict with those conferred by section 19 of the 1954 Act on a managing officer or a managing corporation constituted under that Act.\\nIn other words, to that extent the provisions of section 10 of the 1950 Act and section 19 of the 1954 Act cannot stand together.\\nAs already stated the powers conferred by sub section\\n(1) of section 19 of the 1954 Act are to prevail notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force.\\nTherefore, they must prevail over the provisions of B. 10 of the .\\nIt is true that there, is nothing on record to show that a managing officer was appointed with respect to the Raikot properties acquired under the notification dated March 24, 1955.\\nBut it is not necessary to ascertain that fact.\\nThe point is, who, after the coming into force of the 1954 Act could cancel an allotment.\\nSection 10 says that only a managing officer or a managing corporation can do so.\\nThis means that no one else can do so even though some other law may have authorised another person or authority to cancel an allotment.\\nMr. Achhruram, however, contended that the appellants ' rights were protected by section 10 of the .\\nSection 10 runs as follows: 335 \"Special procedure for payment of compensation in certain cases.\\nWhere any immovable property has been leased or allotted to a displaced person by the Custodian under the conditions published (a)by the notification of the Government of Pun.\\njab in the Department of Rehabilitation No. 4892 S or 4892 S dated the 8th July, 1949, or (b)by the notification of the Government of Patiala and East Punjab States Union in the Department of Rehabilitation No. 8R or 9R, dated the 23rd July, 1949, and published in the official Gazette of that State dated the 7th August, 1949, and such property is acquired under the provisions of this Act and forms part of the compensation pool, the displaced person shall, so long as the property remains vested in the Central Government, continue in possession of such property on the same conditions on which he held the property immediately before the date of the acquisition, and the Central Government may, for the purpose of payment of compensation to such displaced person, transfer to him such property on such terms and conditions as may be prescribed.\\n\" It is followed by an explanation; but that explanation has no bearing upon the point urged by Mr. Achhruram.\\nIt is no doubt true that the Raikot lands were allotted to the appellants under the notification referred to in el.\\n(a) of this section and, therefore, they would be entitled to the benefits conferred by this section provided they satisfied all the other requirements of this section, express or implied.\\nIt is implicit in this section that the displaced person to whom land was allotted \"held\" the land and was in possession of such property at the date of the notification.\\nIt is not disputed that the appellants ceased to hold and had lost possession of the Raikot lands before the publication of this notification.\\nEven assuming that the order of the Custodian cancelling the allotment in their favour was erroneous there will be no difference in the result because what is essential is the facts of holding and possession of the land on the date of the notification.\\n336 Mr. Achhruram then referred to the \"Conditions\" on which allotments of land may be made under the notification referred to in sub section\\n10(a) and pointed out that under condition No. 6 the Custodian or rehabilitation authority would be competent to resume or cancel an allotment only on one of the grounds set out in that condition.\\nHe said that the cancellation of the allotment in favour of the appellants was impermissible inasmuch as it was not based upon any of the grounds set out in the 6th condition.\\nThat may or may not be so.\\nWe would repeat that the appellants had lost their possession before the publication of the notification and are thus not entitled to the protection of the section.\\nMoreover, the Custodian, by reason of the divesting of the property, as from March 24, 1955, had become functus officio with respect to it and could not rectify any error made by him in the past in the matter of cancellation of allotment.\\nIt is true that had the appellants been in possession at the critical time they would have had the right to obtain a permanent transfer in their favour of the Raikot lands and by virtue of what happened and without any fault on their part they have been deprived 'of that right.\\nThat is indeed unfortunate but none of the authorities created by the could rectify the wrong that has been done by them to the appellant.\\nThe question whether it could be rectified by any of the authorities constituted by the or not was not canvassed before us and, therefore, there is no occasion for us to say anything about it.\\nMr. Achhruram contended that r. 74 of the Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Rules, 1955 stood in the way of the Custodian allotting the Raikot property to the respondents during the pendency of the proceedings before the Custodian General.\\nThat rule reads as follows: \"Allotments which are the subject matter of dispute.\\nNo property in a rural area in respect of which any case is pending in a Civil Court or before a Deputy Custodian, Custodian or Custodian General, shall be transferred to the allottee\".\\n337 The aforesaid rule is in Chapter X headed \"Payment of compensation under section 10 of the Act\" and deals with a transfer of property to an allottee by way of final settlement of his claim to compensation and does not deal with the question of allotment on a quasi permanent basis.\\nMoreover, this rule applies to a proceeding before an authority created by the and not to an authority created by the .\\nThere is, therefore, no substance in this argument.\\nFinally Mr. Achhruram referred to section 17 of the 1954 Act and to r. 102 of the Rules framed thereunder and said that the powers of the managing officers appointed under the Act are confined only to properties which are entrusted to them for management and not with respect to any other property.\\nSection 17 deals with the function; and duties of managing officers and managing corporation.\\nSub section\\n(1) provides that managing officers and managing corporations will perform such functions as may be assigned to them under the Act.\\nSub section\\n(2) provides that subject to the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder, a managing officer or a managing corporation may, among other things, take such measures as he or it considers it necessary or expedient for the purpose of securing, administering, preserving, managing or disposing of any property in the compensation pool entrusted to him or it. etc.\\nThe argument is that unless there is such \"entrustment\" the managing officer or managing corporation has no function to perform with respect to evacuee property.\\nHis contention appears to be that there is nothing to show that this property was \"entrusted\" to a managing officer.\\nIn the first place the section confers the particular powers On managing officers or managing corporations only and no one else.\\nTherefore, even if no managing officer or managing corporation was appointed with respect to that property no one else could exercise the power of cancellation of allotment.\\nFurther, there is no ground in the special leave petition or in the statement of the 43 338 case that there is no entrustment in fact of this property or this class of properties to a managing officer or managing corporation.\\nHe cannot, therefore, be permitted to make out a new case at this stage of argument.\\nThat apart, this argument assumes that the property, despite the publication of the notification under section 12(1) of the Act continues to be evacuee property.\\nAgain, this provision is a general provision and the particular provision regarding cancellation of allotment is section 19(1) of the Act which does not refer to entrustment at all and it is this provision which must prevail over the general provision.\\nHe then contends that the provisions of section 19(1) of the Act being subject to rules made under the Act must be read along with r. 102 which deals with cancellation of allotments of leases.\\nThat rule reads thus: \"Cancellation of allotments and leases A managing officer or a managing corporation may sell any property in the compensation pool entrusted to him or to it, cancel an allotment or terminate a lease, or vary the terms of any such lease or allotment if the allottee or lessee, as the case may be (a)has sublet or parted with the possession of the whole or any part of the property allotted or leased to him without the permission of a competent authority, or (b)has used or is using such property for a purpose other than that for which it was allotted or leased to him without the permission of a competent authority, or (c) has committed any act which is destructive of or permanently injurious to the property, or (d) for any other sufficient reason to be recorded in writing; Provided that no action shall be taken under this rule unless the allottee or the lessee, as the case may be, has been given a reasonable opportunity of being heard.\\n\" He points out that in the first place, the rule speaks of land 'entrusted ' to the manager and, therefore would operate only if entrustment is established.\\nWhat we have said in regard to section 17 would apply 339 here also.\\nHe then says that this rule restricts the powers of a managing officer or a managing corporation in the matter of cancellation of allotment in the sense that it permits cancellation only on certain specified grounds and, therefore, it cannot be said that section 19(1) of the Act is completely in conflict with section 10 of the in so far as the question of cancellation of allotment is concerned.\\nWe cannot accept the argument because, apart from the fact that the acquired properties have ceased to be evacuee properties, el.\\n(d) of r. 102 permits the managing officer or managing corporation to cancel allotment \"for any other sufficient reason to be recorded in writing\".\\nThe only effect of r. 102 is to permit cancellation 'of an allotment for reasons stated.\\nThat is all.\\nIn our opinion   \n",

Text: Appeal No. 52 of 1957.\\nAppeal from the judgment and decree dated April 22, of 1953, of the Patna High Court in Appeal from Original Decree No. 162 of 1946.\\nK.N. Bhattacharya and P. K. Chatterjee, for appellants.\\nN.C. Chatterjee, A. V. Viswanatha Sastri, R. section Chatterji and D. N. Mukherjee, for respondents Nos. 2 to 6. 1961.\\nMarch 22.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by SUBBA RAO, J.\\nThis appeal by certificate granted is directed against the judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Patna dated April 23, 1953, confirming that of the Subordinate Judge, Dhanbad, dated November 30, 1946.\\nThe plaintiffs and the defendant are adjoining colliery owners at Kujama.\\nThe plaintiffs ' land lies immediately to the south of the defendants ' land.\\nOn August 2, 1,894, Raja of Jharia granted mukarrari lease of the coal and coal mining rights in 300 bighas of land in village Kujama to Satya Karan Banerjee and Girish Chandra Samanta.\\nOn June 15,1900, his son, Raja Durga Prasad Singh, granted coal and coal 494 mining rights in respect of 400 bighas out of 592 bighas to one Jugal Kishore Lal.\\nSamanta purchased the leasehold interest of Banerji, and thereafter on November 23, 1900, it appears that Samanta bad surrendered his rights under the previous lease in favour of the Raja and taken a fresh lease of the same 300 bighas on a reduced rent.\\nOn June 10, 1901, Jugal Kishore Lal granted a lease of 96 bighas out of his 400 bighas to one D. M. Mathews.\\nOn the very same day D. M. Mathews, in his turn, granted a lease to one Walji Kheta in respect of the said 96 bighas.\\nWalji Kheta executed a kabuliat in favour of M. Mathews on October 11, 1901.\\nWalji Kheta represented the defendants.\\nBy diverse transfers, the interest of Samanata vested in Bagdigi Kujama Collieries Limited.\\nThe plaintiffs case was that as a result of a letter written by the Inspector of Mines on August 18, 1941, the plaintiffs made an inquiry and came to know that the defendants had encroached upon their coal mines on the northern side and removed coal from the encroached portion and had rendered the remaining coal of the encroached portion unworkable.\\nOn those allegations, they asked for the following reliefs: (a)That the intermediate boundary line between the plaintiffs ' coal land and the defendants ' coal land be ascertained and fixed.\\n(b)That the area encroached upon by the defendants be ascertained and the defendants be directed to vacate the same,.\\n(c)That a permanent injunction be issued against the defendants restraining them from encroaching upon the plaintiffs ' coal land and cutting and removing coal therefrom.\\n(d)That an enquiry be made and the quantity of coal cut and removed by the defendants from the plaintiffs ' coal land as also the quantity of the coal rendered unworkable be ascertained and a decree for the value thereof by way of damages be granted to the plaintiffs against the defendants.\\nThe defendants denied that they had encroached upon the plaintiff , ' coal land and stated that the suit was barred by limitation.\\nThey further pleaded that the 495 plaintiffs would not be entitled to any damages.\\nThe learned Subordinate Judge held that the defendant had encroached upon the plaintiff ' coal land, that the suit was not barred by limitations and that they would be entitled to the reliefs prayed for.\\nOn appeal, the High Court of Patna accepted all the findings of the learned Subordinate Judge and dismissed the appeal.\\nHence the present appeal.\\nThe first question that arises for consideration is whether the defendants had encroached Upon the plaintiffs ' coal land.\\nThe answer to this question depends upon the correct, delineation of the boundary line between the plaintiffs ' leasehold and the defendants ' leasehold.\\nIt is common case that the southern boundary of the appellants ' leasehold is conterminous with the northern boundary of the respondents ' lease hold.\\nLearned counsel for the appellant contends that the said boundary should be fixed solely with reference to the boundaries given in the lease of 1894, whereas learned counsel for the respondents contends that no plan has been annexed to the said lease and, therefore, the boundary could more satisfactorily and definitely be fixed with reference to the plans annexed to the subsequent lease deeds executed in favour of the successors in interest of the appellant and the respondents.\\nTo appreciate the rival contentions it is necessary to consider the various lease deeds in some detail.\\nOn August 2, 1894, Raja Jaimangal Singh executed the lease deed (exhibit 1) in respect of 300 bighas in favour of the respondents ' predecessor in interest.\\nIn that lease deed the northern boundary is described to be the remaining portion of mauza Kujama and the western boundary is described as Chatkari Jorh.\\nThe foot note to the lease reads, \"measuring 1101 feet in length running north and south by the side of the said Chatkari Jorh and area being 300 bighas by such measurement\".\\nNo plan was annexed to this lease deed.\\nOn June 15, 1900, Jugal Kishore Lal, the predecessor in interest of the appellant, had obtained a lease (exhibit C) of 400 bighas 496 from Raja Durga Prasad Singh, the son of the previous Raja.\\nThe southern boundary of this leasehold is given as the northern boundary limit of the leasehold land of Girish Chandra Samanta and others and the western boundary is shown as the eastern boundary of Chatkari Jorh as per the map annexed.\\nThis lease deed clearly shows that the southern boundary of this plot is conterminous with the northern boundary of the leasehold land in favour of Samanta.\\nIt may also be noticed at this stage that the map annexed to this lease deed has not been filed by the appellants.\\nIt appears that Samanta purchased the interest of Banerji in the leasehold of 1894 and thereafter at the request of Samanta, on November 23, 1900, Durga Prasad Singh gave a fresh lease of the same holding to Samanta and incorporated a map in that lease, i.e., exhibit 3(b).\\nThere, the northern boundary of the leasehold is described as the leasehold of Rajkumar Jugal Kishore Lal Singh Bahadur.\\nThe plan, exhibit 3(b), annexed to this lease deed shows the boundary line between the two leaseholds.\\nThe said plan is drawn to scale and the boundary line is drawn between point A marked in the plan and point B marked therein.\\nAs the plan is a part of the lease deed, it is clear from the plan that the northern boundary of the leasehold of Samanta is the said line.\\nOn June 10, 1901, Jugal Kishore Lal, that is, the predecessor in interest of the appellant demised a plot of 96 bighas carved out from his leasehold to Mathews under a deed exhibit C(1).\\nMathews in turn demised under exhibit D the said land of 96 bighas to Walji Khetan representing the appellant.\\nIn both these documents the southern boundary is shown as the northern boundary of the leasehold land of Samanta.\\nOne interesting feature is that a map has been referred to in each of the documents and the said map shows that the line drawn from point A to point B is the boundary between the two leaseholds.\\nIt may be mentioned that the said boundary line is exactly the same as that found in exhibit 3(b).\\nThese documents to which the defendants ' predecessors were parties contain a clear admission that the boundary line between the two leaseholds i.e., between appellant 's and that of the respondents ' is the line between 497 A and B shown in plan exhibit 3(b).\\nWe have no doubt that if the plan annexed to exhibit C was produced by the appellant, it would have also established that the dividing line between the two leaseholds is that found in exhibit 3(b).\\nThe appellant, in our view, has suppressed the said plan and, therefore, in the circumstances, we are justified to draw an inference that, if produced, it would be against appellant 's contention.\\nFrom the aforesaid documentary evidence we hold, agreeing with the courts below, that the southern boundary of the appellant 's holding, which is conterminous with the northern boundary of the respondents ' holding, is the line between points A and B shown in exhibit 3(b).\\nThe next question addressed by the courts below is how to ascertain the point A.\\nThe argument of learned counsel for the appellant is that the map translated into words indicates that the correct boundary should be a line drawn from the true meeting point of the four villages Pandebera, Jharia Khas, Lodhna and Kujama at a bearing of 82.15 ', whereas the contention of the respondents is that the line actually drawn on the lease map correctly lays down the northern boundary of the respondents ' leasehold.\\nIt is settled law that a map referred to in a lease should be treated as incorporated in the lease and as forming part of the document: see Darapali Sadagar vs Najir Ahamed (1).\\nAs in this case the map is drawn to scale and incorporated in the lease deed, it is not permissible to ignore the starting point of the boundary line and adopt instead any scientific point based on survey.\\nThe Commissioner appointed by the court tested the position of the six trijunction pillars shown in the map of lease dated November 23, 1900, and found that two of the trijunction pillars were in their correct positions.\\nOn the basis of these two trijunction pillars, the Commissioner relaid, by the process of superimposition, the northern boundary line of the leasehold property, The point A in the map so laid does not tally with the point where the aforesaid four villages actually meet.\\nHe pointed out that the correct (1)(1923) I.L.R 50 Cal 394 63 498 point where the said four villages met would be 1680 feet only from the trijunction pillar of Lodhna, Kujama and Madhuban, whereas the point A was at a distance of 1750 feet from the said trijunction pillar.\\nBut learned counsel for the appellant contends that according to exhibit 3 the western boundary should be according to the revenue plan and, therefore, point A should be fixed at a distance of 1680 feet from the trijunction pillar, as that is the distance according to the revenue plan.\\nBut a perusal of exhibit I shows that there is no reference in regard to the western boundary to revenue records.\\nThat apart, even if 1680 feet is taken as the distance between the injunction pillar and point A in 'the map, it demonstrates that the measurement given in exhibit 3 was incorrect, for, there the distance was shown only as 1101 feet.\\nBut a more serious objection to the argument is that it is not permissible for a court to reconstruct the plan with reference to revenue records when the plan is self contained and drawn to scale.\\nTo summarize: the question is whether the disputed extent is part of the respondents ' holding or that of the appellant 's holding.\\nThe map, exhibit 3(b), annexed to the lease deed executed in favour of the respondents ' predecessor in interest clearly demarcates the boundary line between the holdings of the appellant and the respondents, and according to that plan the disputed extent falls within the boundary of the respondents ' holding.\\nThe lease of the appellant 's predecessor, i.e., exhibit C, also refers to a map, but the appellant withheld it.\\nIn the sub leases created by the appellant, maps were annexed and the boundary therein is in accord with that in exhibit 3(b).\\nThose documents contain clear admissions supporting the case of the respondents.\\nNo reliance can be placed upon the recitals in exhibit 1, as it is demonstrated that the extent given in respect of the western boundary is incorrect.\\nOn the aforesaid material both the courts have held that the disputed extent of land is part of the holding of the respondents.\\nIt is well settled that a map referred to in a lease should be treated as incorporated in the lease and as 499 forming part of the said document.\\nIn this case the maps accepted by us are drawn to scale and the boundary is clearly demarcated.\\nThe courts were, therefore, certainly right in accepting the boundaries drawn in the plan without embarking upon an attempt to correct them with reference to revenue records.\\nThe question really is one of fact and we accept the finding.\\nThe next question is whether the suit was barred by limitation.\\nThe encroachment by the appellant on the respondents ' colliery and the removal of coal therefrom are alleged to have taken place in or about the year 1932.\\nThe respondents in the plaint averred that they came to know of the said encroachment and removal of coal by the appellant after they received the letter dated August 18, 1941, from the Inspector of Mines and before that they had absolutely no knowledge or information whatsoever regarding thereto.\\nThe appellant denied the said allegation and stated that the respondents all along knew and had been aware that the portion of coal land in question belonged to and was the property of the appellant.\\nIn particular the appellant alleged that the respondents must have the knowledge of it since 1932 when there was a survey by the Department of Mines.\\nOn the said pleadings issue 3 was framed which reads, \"Is the suit barred by limitation?\" The learned Subordinate Judge found, on the evidence, that the proceedings in 1932 had nothing to do with the delineation of the boundary line between the two holdings.\\nHe held that article 48 of the Limitation Act applied to the suit and that the appellant had failed to prove that the respondents had knowledge of the sinking of the quarries and pits in the encroached land.\\nOn appeal the High Court accepted the finding.\\nThough the High Court held that the burden of proof to establish knowledge on the part of the respondents beyond the prescribed time was on the appellant, it has given the finding on the assumption that the initial burden was on the respondents to prove that they had knowledge of the said encroachment only within three years thereof.\\nThere are, therefore, concurrent findings of fact on the 500 question of knowledge.\\nBut learned counsel for the appellant contended that the finding is vitiated by the burden of proof having been wrongly thrown on the appellant.\\nThis submission is not accurate, for, as we have pointed out, the High Court arrived at the finding of fact on the assumption that the initial burden of proof was on the respondents.\\nIt is common case that article 48 of the Limitation Act governs the period of limitation in respect of the present suit.\\nIt reads: ___________________________________________________________ Period Time from Description of suit.\\nof which period limitation begins to run.\\n___________________________________________________________ For specific moveable When the per property lost, or son having acquired by theft, or the right to dishonest misappro the posses priation or conver Three sion of the sion, or for com years.\\nproperty first pensation for wrong learns in ful taking or detain whose posses ing the same.\\nsion itis.\\n__________________________________________________________ The article says that a suit for recovery of specific movable property acquired by conversion or for compensation for wrongful taking or detaining of the suit property should be filed within three years from the date when the person having the right to the possession of the property first learns in whose possession it is.\\nThe question is, on whom the burden to prove the said knowledge lies? The answer will be clear if the article is read as follows: A person having the right to the possession of a property wrongfully taken from him by another can file a suit to recover the said specific moveable property or for compensation therefore within three years from the date when lie first learns in whose possession it is.\\nObviously where a person has a right to sue within three years from the date of his coming to know of a, certain fact, it is for him to prove that he had the knowledge of the said fact on a particular date, for 501 the said fact would be within his peculiar knowledge.\\nThat apart, section 3 of the Limitation Act makes it obligatory on a court to dismiss a suit barred by limitation, although limitation has not been set up as a defence, indicating thereby that it is the duty of a plaintiff to establish, at any rate prima facie, that the suit is within time.\\nIt is the obligation of the plaintiff to satisfy the court that his action is not barred by lapse of time: see Lalchand Marwari vs Mahanth Rampur Gir (1) and Rajah Sahib Perhlad Sein vs Maharajah Rajender Kishore Sing (2) .\\nLooking from a different perspective, we arrive at the same result.\\nUnder the Evidence Act there is an essential distinction between the phrase \"burden of proof\" as a matter of law and pleading and as a matter of adducing evidence.\\nUnder section 101 of the Evidence Act, the burden in the former sense is upon the party who comes to court to get a decision on the existence of certain facts which he asserts.\\nThat burden is constant throughout the trial; but the burden to prove in the sense of adducing evidence shifts from time to time having regard to the evidence adduced by one party or the other or the presumption of fact or law raised in favour of one or the other.\\nIn the present case the burden of proof in the former sense is certainly on the respondents.\\nBut the question is whether they have adduced evidence which had the effect of shifting the onus of proof to the appellant.\\nOn behalf of the respondents, their Colliery Manager was examined as P. W. 2.\\nHe stated in his evidence that the appellant had encroached upon the South Kujamal Colliery in Seam Nos. 10, 11 and 12 and another special seam, known as 4 feet seam and that in August, 1941, be came to know about the encroachment for the first time when the Mines Department forwarded a plan of the joint workings of the two collieries of the parties.\\nHe also stated that he had no knowledge of the encroachment before.\\nIn the cross examination, two suggestions were made to him, namely, that in 1932 there was a survey of the plaintiffs ' and defendants ' coal land by the Mines Department and that Seam Nos. 11 and 12 were (1) Pat. 312.\\n(2) (1869) 12 M.I.A. 292.\\n502 worked by the appellant by open quarry system.\\nHe denied that he had any knowledge of the said two facts.\\nThe evidence of this witness has been accepted by the learned Subordinate Judge, and the High Court also accepted his evidence, though in its view it was not very satisfactory.\\nThis evidence, therefore, prima facie, proves that the respondents had knowledge of the encroachment only in 1941.\\nLet us now consider some of the decisions cited at the Bar.\\nA division beach of the Patna High Court in Sundarji Shivji vs Secretary of State for India (1) held that \"when a defendant in an action based on tort seeks to show that the suit is not maintainable by reason of the expiry of the statutory period of limitation, it is upon him to prove the necessary facts\".\\nThere the suit was for conversion of property, and the learned Judges applied article 48 of the Limitation Act to the said suit.\\nAfter noticing the words in the last column of the article, the learned Judges proceeded to observe thus: \" The starting date of limitation in the case of conversion is the date when the person who has the right to possession first learns of the act of conversion.\\n\" Adverting to the burden of proof, the learned Judges observed: \"There is nothing in the pleadings which would show precisely at what period tile plaintiff or the plaintiff 's agent, which is the same thing, became aware of the sale and its wrongfulness, that is to say, became aware of the fact of conversion.\\nThe defendant was unable to provide us with any materials to fix that date and therefore his plea of limitation fails altogether, because he is unable to show a date outside the period of three years which would entitle him to succeed.\\n\" With great respect to the learned Judges, we hold that this case had not been correctly decided.\\nThe burden of proof, as we have explained earlier is on a plaintiff who asserts a right,    \n",

Text: Appeals Nos. 45 and 46 of 1959.\\nAppeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated March 25, 1957, of the former Bombay High Court in Appeal No. 16 of 1957.\\nQ. K. Daphtary, Solicitor General of India, H. J. Umrigar and D. Gupta, for the Apellant (In C. A. No. 45 of 59) and Respondent (In C. Appeal No. 46 of 59).\\nH. N. Sanyal, Additional Solicitor General of India, section N. Andley and J. B. Dadachanji, for the respondents (in C. A. No. 45 of 59) and Appellants (In C. A. No. 46/59).\\n926 1960.\\nSeptember 27.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS GUPTA J.\\nM/s.\\nDaulatram Rameshwarlal, a firm registered under the Indian Partnership Act (referred to later in this judgment as \"sellers \") are registered dealers under section 11 of the Bombay Sales Tax Act.\\nIn their return of turnover for the period from April 1, 1954 to March 31, 1955, they claimed exemption from Sales Tax in respect of sales of cotton of the total value of Rs. 68,493 2 6 and sales of castor oil of the total value of Rs. 6,47,509 1 6 on the ground that these sales were oil FOB contracts, under which they continued to be the owners of the goods till the goods had crossed the customs barrier and thus entered the export stream, and so no tax was realisable on these sales in view of the provisions of article 286 (1)(b).\\nThe Sales Tax Officer rejected this claim for exemption and assessed them to sales tax on a taxable turnover including these sales.\\nHe also assessed them to purchase tax under section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act on their purchase of castor oil which they later sold for the sum of Rs. 6,47,509 1 6 as mentioned above.\\nThe notice of demand for the total sales tax and the purchase tax assessed was served on the sellers on September 30, 1956.\\nThe sellers thereupon moved the Bombay High Court under article 226 of the Constitu tion for the issue of appropriate writs for quashing the order of assessment and the notice of demand and for prohibiting the Sales Tax Officer from taking any steps pursuant to the order or the notice.\\nThe learned Judge who heard the petition rejected the sellers ' contention that the goods remained their property till these crossed the customs frontier and therefore held that the sellers were not entitled to the benefit of article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution.\\nAs regards the assessment to purchase tax also he rejected the sellers ' contention that the assessment in question was illegal.\\nIn this view the learned Judge dismissed the application under article 226.\\nAgainst this decision the sellers appealed.\\nThe 927 learned Judges who heard the appeal held, disagreeing with the Trial Judge, that the goods remained the sellers ' property till the goods had been brought on board the ship and so the sales were exempted from tax under article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution.\\nThey however agreed with the Trial Judger that the sellers were liable to pay purchase tax under section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act.\\nAccordingly they directed the Sales Tax Officer not to enforce the demand for payment of sales tax with regard to the sales of cotton for Rs. 68,493 2 6 and sale of castor oil of the total value of Rs. 6,47,509 1 6.\\nThe Sales Tax Officer has, on the strength of special leave granted by this Court, preferred the appeal which has been numbered as Civil Appeal No. 45 of 1959 against the appellate court 's order directing him not to realise the sales tax in respect of sales of cotton and castor oil.\\nCivil Appeal No. 46 of 1959 has been preferred by the sellers against the appellate court 's judgment in so far as it upheld the assessment of purchase tax under section 10(b).\\nThe only \"question for our decision in the appeal by the Sales Tax Officer is whether property in the goods passed on shipment or at some point of time before shipment.\\nThe law is now well settled that if the property in the goods passes to the buyer after they have for the purpose of export to a foreign country crossed the customs frontier the sale has taken place \"in course of the export\" out of the territory of India.\\nIf therefore in the present sales the property in the goods passed to the buyers on shipment, that is, after they had crossed the customs frontier the sales must be held to have taken place \"in the course of export\" and the exemption under article 286(1)(b) will come into operation.\\nThe sellers ' case is that these were sales on FOB contracts.\\nThough the learned Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the Sales Tax Officer tried to convince us that these were not really FOB contract sales, it appears that the averment in Paras.\\n11 and 13 of the writ petition that these sales were made on FOB basis were not denied in the counter affidavit sworn by the Sales Tax Officer.\\nIt is also 928 worth noticing that in the assessment order itself the Sale Tax Officer referred to these sales as sales on FOB basis.\\nThe specimen contract produced also used the words \" FOB delivered \".\\nThere can be no doubt therefore that these were sales under FOB contracts. ' The normal rule in FOB contracts is that the property is intended to pass and does pass on the shipment of the goods.\\nIn certain circumstances, e.g., if the seller takes the bill of , lading to his own order and parts with it to a third person the property in the goods, it has been held, does not pass to the buyer even on shipment.\\nWe are not concerned here with the question whether the passing of property in the goods was postponed even after shipment.\\nThe correctness of the proposition that in the absence of special agreement the property in the goods does not pass in the case of a FOB contract until the goods are actually put on board is not disputed before us.\\nAs has however been rightly stressed by the learned Solicitor General it is always open to the parties to come to a different agreement as to when the Dropert in the goods shall pass.\\nThe question whether there was such a different agreement has to be decided on a consideration of all the surrounding circumstances.\\nHe relies on three circumstances to convince us that the sellers and their buyers agreed in these sales that the property will pass to the buyer even before shipment.\\nThe first circumstance on which he relies is that the bill of lading was taken in the name of the buyer.\\nAlong with this fact we have to consider however the fact that the bill of lading was retained by the sellers, the contract being that payment will be made on the presentation of the bill of lading.\\nIt is not disputed that the term in the contract for \"payment at Bombay against presentation of documents \" means this.\\nIt was the sellers who received the bills of lading and it was on the presentation of these bills of lading along with the invoices that the buyer paid the price.\\nWhen the bills of lading though made out as if the goods were shipped by the buyer, were actually obtained and retained by the sellers, that fact itself would ordinarily indicate an intention of 929 the parties that the property in the goods would not pass till after payment.\\nThe second circumstance to which our attention has been drawn is that the export was under the contract to be under the buyer 's export licence.\\nThis, in our opinion, shows nothing.\\nThe ordinary rule in FOB contracts is that it is the duty of the buyer to obtain the necessary export licence.\\nThat was laid down in Brandt 's case (1) and though in a later case in Hardy vs Pound (2) the Court of Appeal in England held that the judgment in Brandt 's case (1) does not cover every FOB contract and that in the special facts of the particular case before them it was for the sellers to obtain the licence and this view was approved by the House of Lords , it is in our opinion correct to state that the presumption in FOB contracts is that it is the duty of the buyers to obtain export licence, though in the circumstances of a particular case this duty may fall on the sellers.\\nThe third circumstance on which reliance is placed on behalf of the Sales Tax Officer is that the Export Control Order, 1954, which was passed in the exercise of powers conferred by Import & Export Control Act, 1947, contained a provision in its clause 5(2) in these words: \" It shall be deemed to be a condition of that licence. . . that the goods for the export of which licence is granted shall be the property of the licensee at the time of the export \".\\nIt has been strenuously contended by the learned Solicitor General that it will be reasonable to think that the parties to the contract intended to comply with this condition and to agree as between themselves that the goods shall be the property of the licensee, that is, the buyer, at the time of the export.\\nIt is argued that the time of the export should be interpreted as the time when the customs frontier is crossed and that we must proceed on the basis that the buyer and the sellers intended that the goods shall be the buyer 's property at the point of time when they crossed this frontier.\\nWe see however no justification for thinking that in this clause \"the time of the export \" means the time (1) (2) 930 when the goods cross the customs frontier.\\nExport has been defined in the Import & Export (Control) Act, 1947, as \" taking out of India by sea, land or air \".\\nIn the Exports (Control) Order, 1954, the word must be taken to have the same meaning as in the Act.\\nOn that definition the time of the export is the time when the goods go out of the territorial limits of India.\\nThese territorial limits would include the territorial waters of India.\\nConsequently the time of the export is when the ship with the goods goes be yond the territorial limits.\\nAt any rate, the export of the goods cannot be considered to have commenced before the ship carrying goods leaves the port.\\nThe intention of the parties that in compliance with the requirements of cl.\\n5(2) of the Exports (Control) Order the goods shall be the property of the licensee at the time of the export would therefore mean nothing more than that the property in the goods shall pass immediately before the ship goes beyond the territorial waters of the country, or at the earliest when the ship leaves the port.\\nWhichever view is taken there is nothing to indicate that the intention to comply with the requirements of el.\\n5(2) of the Exports (Control) Order carries with it an intention that the property should pass to the buyer at the time the goods cross the customs frontier.\\nIt is true that in the United Motor '8 Case (1) and in other cases it has been held by this Court that the course of export commences to run when the goods cross the customs barrier.\\nWhat the court had to consider in these cases was not however when export commences within the meaning of the Exports (Control) Order but when the course of export commences for the purpose of article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution.\\nFor the reasons which need not be detailed here it was decided that the course of export commences at the time when the goods cross the customs barrier.\\nThese decisions as regards the commencement of the course of export are of no assistance in deciding about the point of time when the export proper commences.\\nAs we have already pointed out when export has been defined in the Import & Export (1) (1953) 4 S.T.C. 133. 931 (Control) Act, 1947, as \"taking out of India by land, sea, or air \", export in the Export Control Order, cannot be held to have commenced till at least the ship carrying the goods has left the port, though it may in some contexts be more correct to say that it does not commence till the ship has passed beyond the territorial waters.\\nWe have therefore come to the conclusion that there is no circumstance which would justify a conclusion that the parties came to a special agreement that though the sales were on FOB contracts property in the goods would pass to the buyer at some point of time before shipment.\\nWe think that the learned judges who heard the appeal in the Bombay High Court were right in their conclusion that the goods remained the sellers ' property till the goods had been brought and loaded on board the ship and so the sales were exempted from tax under article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution.\\nIn Civil Appeal No. 46 of 1959 the appellants ' contention is that on a correct interpretation of the provisions of section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act no purchase tax was leviable from them.\\nSection 10(b) provides for the levy of a purchase tax on the turnover of purchase of goods specified in column I of Schedule B, at the rates, if any, specified against such goods in column 4 of the said schedule, \"where a certificate under cl.\\n(b) of section 8 has been furnished in respect of such goods and the purchasing dealer does not show to the satisfaction of the Collector that the goods have been despatched by him or by a person to whom he has sold the goods to an address outside the State of Bombay within a period of six months from the date of purchase by the dealer furnishing such certificate \".\\nSection 8(b) provides for the deduction from the turnover, of sale of goods to a dealer who holds an authorisation and furnishes to the selling dealer a certificate in the prescribed form declaring inter alia that the goods so sold to him are intended for being despatched by him or by registered dealers to whom he sells the goods to an address outside the State of Bombay.\\nAdmittedly such a certificate was furnished by 932 M/s. Daulatram Rameshwarlal in respect of the castor oil which they sold to others and that in respect of these sales to them their sellers were allowed deductions.\\nIt is equally undisputed that the persons to whom M/s. Daulatram Rameshwarlal sold the goods were sent to an address outside the State of Bombay within a period of six months from the date of purchase by M/s. Daulatram Rameshwarlal.\\nThese persons are however not registered dealers.\\nThe Sales Tax Officer as also the High Court of Bombay has held that the \" person to whom he has sold the goods \" in section 10(b) means \" a registered dealer to whom he has sold the goods \".\\nIt is contended before us on behalf of the appellant dealers that the word \" a person \" is wide enough to include a registered dealer and an unregistered dealer.\\nIt is urged that the use of the word it a person \" instead of the words \" a registered dealer \" is deliberate and that it was the intention of the Legislature to levy purchase tax on a person who has given such certificate under section 8(b) only if the goods were not 'despatched outside the State of Bombay within the prescribed period by anybody.\\nIt is therefore contended that \" a person \" in section 8(b) should be interpreted to include a registered dealer or anybody else.\\nWe are unable to agree.\\nA close examination of sections 8 and 10 justifies the conclusion that the Legislature was anxious to secure that the declaration as regards intention of the goods being despatched outside the State of Bombay should be carried out by despatch by \" a registered dealer \" to whom he sells the goods.\\nIf such despatch outside the State of Bombay is by a person to whom the certifying dealer has sold the goods but who is not a registered dealer the certificate has not been complied with.\\nIt will be in our opinion unreasonable to think that though the Legislature insisted that the certificate should declare the goods purchased were intended 11 for being despatched by him or by a registered dealer to whom he sells the goods outside the State of Bombay \", the Legislature would be content to accept actual despatch outside the State of Bombay by one who is not a registered dealer as sufficient.\\nMr. Sanyal contended that the certificate 933 has to declare only an intention and that if ultimately the actual despatch is made by some person who is not a registered dealer, it cannot strictly be said that the declaration has not been carried out.\\nIt might very well be that if at the time a declaration of intention is made in the certificate the purchasing dealer had the intention as stated and ultimately he sells to a person who is not a registered dealer for despatch of the goods outside the State of Bombay, the purchasing dealer may not be liable for having made a false declaration \".\\nEven though he has not made a false declaration of his intention, the fact remains that the intention declared has not been carried out.\\nThe scheme of the Legislature clearly is that where the intention as declared has not been carried out purchase tax should be levied.\\nTo hold otherwise would be to make the declaration of the intention useless.\\nOur conclusion therefore is that the courts below have rightly interpreted the words \" a person \" in section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act as a \" registered dealer \" and that the purchasing dealers have rightly been assessed to purchase tax under section 10(b).\\nIn the result, both the appeals are dismissed with costs.\\nAppeals dismissed.   \n",

Text: ION: Criminal Appeal 89 of 1961.\\nAppeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated December 8, 1960, of the Allahabad High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 1782 of 60 and Referred No. 125 of 1960, section K. Kapur, for the appellant, G. C. Mathur and C. P. Lal, for the respondent.\\nDecember 19.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by RAGUHBAR DAYAL, J.\\nRam Singh appeals, by special leave, against the order of the Allahabad High Court dismissing his appeal and confirming 204 his conviction and sentence of death, under section 302, I.P.C., by the Session Judge, Etawah.\\nThe prosecution case, in brief, is that due to enmity, the appellant caused injuries to Sheo Sahai, who was sleeping in his cattle shed in village Bhadurpur Ghar, with a sword at about mid night on the night between June 14 15, 1960.\\nSheo Sahai died of the injuries received.\\nThe appellant thereafter proceeded to the Canal Distributory at some distance from the village and had a bath there.\\nLater on, he went to the Police Station, Ekdil, nine miles away and lodged a report.\\nHe delivered the sword which has been found by the Serologist to be stained with human blood.\\nThe appellant was taken in custody and as a result of the investigation was sent up for trial, The appellant denied the allegation that he had caused the death of Sheo Sahai and alleged that he was falsely accused of the offence.\\nHe also denied the other allegations for the prosecution.\\nHe alleged that one Paley Singh informed him about the murder of Sheo Sahai and asked him to go to the Police Station, Ekdil, and to inform the Station Officer orally about the murder.\\nHe did accordingly.\\nHe was detained at the Police Station till 11 a.m., the next day and was then put up in the lock up.\\nThe Sub Inspector took his thumb impression forcibly on three papers, but did not tell him the reason.\\nThe appellant adduced no evidence in support of his statement.\\nThe Courts below rightly did not accept his version.\\nThe evidence led by the prosecution consisted of the evidence relating to motive, to his extrajudicial confession to one Ujagar Singh when he was having a bath in the Canal, to his purchasing the sword and to his delivering it at the police Station after he had dictated the report.\\nBoth the Courts below rightly believed the evidence about the motive and purchase of the sword by the appellant.\\n205 The learned Sessions Judge believed Ujagar Singh and acted on the extra judicial confession made by the appellant to him.\\nThe High Court, however, did not rely on this extra judicial confession.\\nIt relied on certain statements made by the appellant in his report dictated at the Police Station and considered those facts together with the motive and the evidence about the purchase of the sword sufficient to confirm the appellant 's conviction and sentence.\\nThe learned counsel for the appellant has argued that the entire report dictated by the appellant was inadmissible in evidence as its contents amounted to a confession of the offence by the appellant made to a Police Officer and that the evidence relied upon by the High Court was insufficient to establish that the appellant had murdered Sheo Sahai.\\nOn the other hand, learned Counsel for the respondent urged that the High Court was wrong in rejecting the statement of Ujagar Singh about the appellant 's extra judicial confession and that the extra judicial confession together with the circumstances relied on by the High Court, fully make out the prosecution case against the appellant.\\nHe also urges that such portions of the report which did not amount to a direct admission of the appellant 's striking Sheo Sahai with a sword and thereby causing his death were admissible in evidence.\\nWe do not consider it necessary to decide whether any portion of the report dictated by the appellant at the Police Station is admissible or not in evidence, as there is good independent evidence with respect to the four matters mentioned in the report and relied on by the High Court in considering the case against the appellant.\\nThese admissions of the appellant are (i) that he purchased a cycle from the deceased; (ii) that there was a quarrel in a play of cards; (iii) that he purchased a sword; and (iv) that he deposited the sword at the Police Station.\\n206 Ajit Singh, P.W., 5 deposed about the purchase of the cycle and about a dispute taking place between Sheo Sahai and the appellant on account of the latter 's demanding the return of Rs. 10/ which had been paid towards the sale price as the balance of the sale price had not been paid and the deal was cancelled by Sheo Sahai in accordance with the oral contract.\\nAjit Singh bears no enmity with the appellant.\\nIn fact, none of the prosecution witnesses is alleged to bear enmity with the appellant.\\nPaley Singh, P.W. 2, and Baij Nath P.W. 4, depose about the dispute during the game of cards played on June 12, 1960.\\nKehar Singh P.W.3.\\ndeposed about the selling of a sword to the appellant on June 13, 1960.\\nA receipt about the sale was found on the person of the appellant when he was searched after his arrest.\\nThe appellant 's depositing the sword at the Police Station is deposed by Madho Ram P.W. 12, and by Sri Kishan Singh, Station Officer, Ekdil, (P.W. 16), in whose presence the appellant had dictated the report.\\nIt is therefore not necessary to rely on the admissions of the appellant in the report with respect to these facts deposed to by the various witnesses whose testimony has been rightly accepted.\\nWe need also consider whether the facts that the accused had a motive to harm Sheo Sahai and that he had purchased a sword a day before the incident and deposited it stained with human blood at the Police Station on the night of the murder are sufficient to establish that it must be the appellant who committed the murder of Sheo Sahai or not, as we are of opinion that the High Court erred in rejecting the statement of Ujagar Singh about the appellant 's confessing to him that he had murdered Sheo Sahai.\\n207 In this connection, the High Court simply said: \"A perusal of the statement of Ujagar Singh would show that it is very likely that this may have happened.\\nTo us, it seems that in the middle of June when the chari and sugar cane crop would not have been very high, it seems improbable that Ujagar Singh would have been sleeping in his field or that he should have met the appellant in the manner alleged.\\nWe do not feel sure of the extra judicial confession said to have been made by the appellant to Ujagar Singh, and consequently we do not place any reliance on his statement, though it has been relied upon by the court below.\\n\" With respect to the learned Judges, these observations are not very consistent.\\nIf Ujagar Singh 's statement made it very likely that what he stated did happen, there could not have appeared any improbability in Ujagar Singh 's sleeping in his field and meeting the appellant in the manner alleged, especially when the learned Judges believed, and there was evidence about it, that the fields had chari and sugarcane crop at the time.\\nThe learned Judges have not stated those considerations, if any, in addition to the improbability of Ujagar Singh 's presence in his field on account of the crops being not very high, which made them doubt the appellant 's confessing to Ujagar Singh.\\nIt may be mentioned that Ujagar Singh was on the field, according to his statement, for protecting the crop from the depradations of neel gais.\\nThey damage the leaves of the plants and have no partiality for tall plants alone.\\nIn fact, the smaller the plants, the easier it must be to graze.\\nThe learned Sessions Judge has discussed the criticism urged before him against the acceptance of the statement of Ujagar Singh and considered 208 it, for reasons given, not to justify the rejection of Ujagar Singh 's statement.\\nWe agree with those reasons.\\nThere is no enmity between Ujagar Singh and the appellant and therefore no good reasons existed for Ujagar Singh to state falsely.\\nExtra judicial confessions are not usually considered with favour but that does not mean that such a confession coming from a person who has no reason to state falsely and to whom it is made in circumstances which tend to support his statement, should not be believed.\\nThe murder was committed in the month of June.\\nBoth on account of the temperature and on account of the culprit 's desire to wash of blood marks on his person, the appellant 's bathing in the Canal at that hour of the night cannot be said to be improbable.\\nIt is not stated by sub Inspector Kishan Singh, nor it is alleged that the appellant had on his person or on his clothes blood stains when he presented himself at the Police Station.\\nThis tends to support Ujagar Singh 's statement that the appellant had a bath in the Canal at that hour.\\nOf course, this consideration springs out of the supposition that the appellant did commit the murder.\\nThe fact that he had the sword which was stained with human blood, leads to such a supposition, even if the mere possession of a sword so stained be not sufficient to establish conclusively that the person who possessed it so shortly after the murder of a person with whom he had enmity, had committed the murder.\\nThe Canal runs beside Ujagar Singh 's field.\\nUjagar Singh was on the field for the purpose of watching it against the neel gais trespassing and grazing the crop.\\nIt is not therefore a matter of surprise that he wakes up and proceeds to the spot from where the splashing sound which, is supposed to be due to the wading of the neel gais, came.\\nOn reaching the Canal bank, he observes 209 the person bathing and naturally asks him what.\\nled him to have a bath at that hour at night.\\nTaken by surprise, it is not unlikely that the appellant should have made a statement that he had committed the murder of Sheo Sahai and was, thereafter, having a bath.\\nThere is no reason to think that the appellant would not make such a statement when the appellant himself proceeds to the Police Station and hands over the blood stained sword.\\nIt is no doubt unusual, as urged for the appellant, that a person who commits a murder in pursuance of an enmity arising out of minor disputes, would be feeling so justified in his conduct as to openly admit it to the first person he met and to go to the Police Station and report about it.\\nIt is always difficult to find reasons for a person 's acting in a certain manner.\\nIt may be that having blurted out the truth to Ujagar Singh, when taken by surprise, the appellant thought the best thing to be to proceed to the Police Station and report the matter there.\\nIt is true that Ujagar Singh did not rush to the village at once and convey the news of the murder of Sheo Sahai.\\nThe learned Sessions Judge has considered the criticism against such a conduct and has held that there were good reasons for Ujagar Singh 's not leaving his field whose crops he was watching against the neel gais.\\nWe agree with the view of the learned Sessions Judge and do not consider Ujagar Singh 's conduct of continuing to remain on his field during the night to be so improbable as to affect his veracity.\\nUjagar Singh went to the village at about 5 a.m., and them told the people of what he had been told by the appellant.\\nThis statement of his, is supported impliedly by Paley Singh, P.W. 2, who states that the Sub Inspector was not present when Ujagar Singh related to them the fact which had taken place at night and by Bishram Singh, P.W. 13, who 210 deposed that Ujagar Singh stated that Ram Singh was taking his bath at night in the Canal Distributory and had said that he had come after committing the murder of Sheo Sahai and that the appellant had then proceeded towards the police station.\\nWe are therefore of opinion that Ujagar Singh 's statement about the appellant 's confessing to him that he had murdered Sheo Sahai has been erroneously rejected by the High Court.\\nThe extra judicial confession of the appellant to Ujagar Singh finds ample support from the facts that the appellant did purchase a sword a day before, that very sword was found to be stained with human blood shortly after the murder and that sword was handed over by the appellant himself to the Police Officer at the Police Station.\\nThe evidence of the appellant 's having enmity with Sheo Sahai, the appellant 's conduct in purchasing a sword and delivering it stained with human blood to the Police and the appellant 's confession to Ujagar Singh, fully establish that the appellant did commit the murder of Sheo Sahai.\\nWe are therefore of opinion that he has been rightly convicted of the offence under section 302, I.P.C., and has been awarded the proper sentence.\\nWe therefore dismiss the appeal.\\nAppeal dismissed.   \n",

Text: Civil Appeal No. 50 of 1961.\\nAppeal by special leave from the Award dated March 10, 1959, of the Industrial Tribunal.\\nKozhikode, in I.D. No. 89 of 1958.\\nA. V. Viswanatha Sastri and T. V. R. Tatachari, for the appellant, Janardan Sharma, for the resondents.\\nJanuary 29.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by WANCHOO.J.\\nThis is an appeal by special leave in an industrial matter.\\nThe brief facts necessary for present purposes are these.\\nThe appellant in a saw mill carrying on business in Kozihkode in 824 the State of Kerala.\\nOne Sankaran was in the employ of the appellant as a crosscutter.\\nIt is said that on June 21, 1958, Sankaran came drunk to they mill and abused the Engineer, the Secretary and others and threatened them with physical violence.\\nHe was caught hold of by other workmen and taken outside.\\nIt is said that he came again a short time later at 4 30 p.m. and abused the same persons again.\\nThereupon the appellant served a charge sheet on Sankaran on June 24, 1958 acting out the above facts and asked him to show cause why his services should not be terminated on account of his grave indiscipline and misconduct.\\nSankaran gave an explanation the same day denying the allegations of fact made against him, though he admitted that he had come to the mill at the relevant time for taking his wages for that week.\\nOn June 25, 1958 Sankaran was informed that in view of his denial, a departmental inquiry would be held and he was also placed under suspension pending inquiry.\\nThe same day Sankaran protested against his suspension and requested that in any case the departmental inquiry should be expedited.\\nAs no inquiry was held till July 2, 1958, Sankaran again wrote to the appellant to hold the inquiry as early as possible.\\nOn July 8, 1958, the appellant terminated the services of Sankaran under r. 18 (a) of the Standing Orders without holding any departmental inquiry and the order was communicated to Sankaran the same day.\\nIn that order the appellant informed Sankaran that the proposed inquiry, if conducted, would lead to further friction and deterioration in the rank and file of the employees in general and also that maintenance of discipline in the undertaking would be prejudiced if he was retained in the service of the appellant, and therefore it considered that no inquiry should be held.\\nA dispute was then raised by the union which was referred to the industrial tribunal for adjudication by the Government of Kerala in October 1958.\\nThe tribunal held that 825 something seemed to have happened on the afternoon of June 21, 1958 but there was no evidence to prove what had actually happened.\\nIt further held that the appellant had intended to take disciplinary action against the workman but subsequently departmental proceedings were dropped and action was taken under r. 18(a) of the Standing orders.\\nThe tribunal was of the view that this was a colourable exercise of the power given under r. 18(a) to the appellant and therefore its action could not be upheld as a bona fide exercise of the power conferred.\\nThe tribunal also pointed out that no attempt was made before it to defend the action taken under r. 18 (a) by proving the alleged misconduct.\\nTwo witnesses were produced before the tribunal in connection with the alleged misconduct, but the tribunal did not rely on them on the ground that the important witnesses, namely, the Engineer, the Secretary and other members of the staff whose evidence would have been of more value had not been produced and no explanation had been given why they were not produced.\\nThe tribunal therefore held that on the facts it could not come to the conclusion that Sankaran had come drunk to the mill and abused or attempted to assault either the Engineer or the Secretary or other officers.\\nIn the result the order of discharge was set aside and Sankaran was ordered to be reinstated.\\nThe appellant thereupon applied for special leave which was granted; and that is how the matter has come up before us.\\nThe main contention of the appellant is that it is entitled under r. 18 (a) of the Standing Orders to dispense with the service of any employee after complying with its terms.\\nRule 18 (a) is in these terms: \"When the management desires to determine the services of any permanent workmen 826 receiving 12 as.\\nor more as daily wages, otherwise than under rule 21, he shall be given 14 days notice or be paid 12 days wages.\\n\" It may be mentioned that r. 21 deals with case of misconduct and provides for dismissal or suspension for misconduct and in such a case the workman so suspended is not entitled to any wages during the period of suspension.\\nThe claim thus put forward on behalf of the appellant is that it is entitled under r. 18(a) of the Standing orders which is a term of contract between the appellant and its employees to dispense with the service of any employee at any time by just giving 14 days notice or paying 12 days wages.\\nWe are of opinion that this claim of the appellant cannot be accepted, and it is too late in the day for an employer to raise such a claim for it amounts to a claim \"to hire and fire\" an employee as the employer pleases and thus completely negatives security of service which has been secured to industrial employees through industrial adjudication for over a long period of time now.\\nAs far back as 1952, the Labour Appellate Tribunal had occasion to consider this matter relating to discharge by notice or in lieu thereof by payment of wages for a certain period without assigning any reason: (see Buckingham and Carnatic Co. Ltd. Etg.\\nvs Workers of the Company.\\netc.) (1).\\nIt was of opinion that even in a case of this kind the requirement of bona fides is essential and if the terminataton of service is a colourable exercise of the power or as a result of victimisation or unfair labour praction the industrial tribunal would have the jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination.\\nFurther it held that where the termination of service is capricious, arbitrary or unnecessarily harsh on the part of the employer judged by normal standards of a reasonable man that may be cogent evidence of victimisation or unfair labour practice.\\nThese observations 827 of the Labour Appellate Tribunal were approved by this Court in The Chartered Bank, Bombay vs The Chartered Bank Employees ' Union (1).\\nand Assam Oil Company vs Its Workmen (2).\\nTherefore if as in this case the employer wanted to take action for misconduct and then suddenly dropped the departmental proceedings which were intended to be held and decided to discharge the employee under r. 18 (a) of the Standing orders, it was clearly a colourable exercise of the power under that rule in as much as that rule was used to get rid of an employee instead of following the course of holding an inquiry for misconduct, notice for which had been given to the employee and for which a departmental inquiry was intended to be held.\\nThe reason given by the appellant in the order terminating the services of Sankaran of July 8, 1958, namely, that the proposed inquiry, if conducted, would lead to further friction and deterioration in the rank and file of the employees in general and also that maintenance of discipline in the undertaking would be prejudiced if Sankaran were retained in service, cannot be accepted at its face value; so that the necessity for an inquiry intended to be held for misconduct actually charged might be done away with.\\nIn any case even if the inquiry was not held by the appellant and action was taken under r. 18 (a) it is now well settled, in view of the decisions cited above, that the employer could defend the action under r. 18(a) by leading evidence before the tribunal to show that there was in fact misconduct and therefore the action taken under r. 18(a) was bona fide and was not colourable exercise of the power under that rule.\\nBut the tribunal has pointed out that the employer did not attempt to do so before it.\\nIt satisfied itself by producing two witnesses but withholding the important witnesses on this question.\\nIn the circumstances, if the tribunal did not accept the evidence of the two witnesses 828 who were produced it cannot be said to have gone wrong.\\nLearned counsel for the appellant however urges that the employer was empowered to take action under r. 18 (a) of the Standing orders and having taken action under that rule, there was nothing for it to justify before the tribunal.\\nWe have already said that this position cannot be accepted in industrial adjudication relating to termination of service of an employee and has not been accepted by industrial tribunals over a long course of years now and the view taken by industrial tribunals has been upheld by this Court in the two cases referred to above.\\nLearned counsel for the appellant, however, relies on the decision of this Court in Parshotam Lal Dhingra vs Union of India.\\n(1) That was however a case of a public servant and the considerations that apply to such a case are in our opinion entirely different.\\nStress was laid by the learned counsel on the observations at p. 862 where it was observed as follows: \"It is true that the misconduct, negligence inefficiency or other disqualification may be the motive or inducing factor which influences the Government to take action under the terms of the contract of employment or the specific service rule, nevertheless, if a right exists under the contract or the rule, to terminate the service, the motive operating on the mind of the Government is, as Chagla C. J. has said in Srinivas Ganesh vs Union of India (2) (supra), wholly irrelevant.\\nIt is urged that the same principle should be applied to industrial adjudication.\\nIt is enough to say that the position of government servants stands on an entirely different footing as compared to industrial employees.\\nArticles 310 and 311 of the Constitution apply to government servants and it is in the 829 light of those Articles read with the Rules framed under article 309 that questions relating to termination of service of government servants have to be considered.\\nNo such constitutional provisions have to be considered when one is dealing with industrial employees.\\nFurther an employer cannot now press his right purely on contract and say that under the contract he has unfettered right \"to hire and fire\" his employees.\\nThat right is now subject to industrial adjudication and even a power like that granted by r. 18 (a) of the Standing orders in this case, is subject to the scrutiny of industrial courts in the manner indicated above.\\nThe appellant therefore cannot rest its case merely on r. 18 (a) and say that having acted under that rule there is nothing more to be said and that the industrial court cannot inquire into the causes that led to the termination of service under r. 18 (a).\\nThe industrial court in our opinion has the right to inquire into the causes that might have led to termination of service even under a rule like 18(a) and if it is satisfied that the action taken under such a rule was a colourable exercise of power and was not bona fide or was a result of victimisation or unfair labour practice it would have jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination.\\nIn this case the tribunal held that the exercise of power was colourable and it cannot be said that view is incorrect.\\nThe appellant failed to satisfy the tribunal when the matter came before it for adjudication that the exercise of the power in this case was bona fide and was not colourable.\\nIt could have easily done so by producing satisfactory evidence; but it seems to have rested upon its right that no such justification was required and therefore having failed to justify its action must suffer the consequences.\\nLearned counsel for the appellant also drew our attention to another decision of this Court in 830 The Patna Electric Supply Co. Ltd. Patna vs Bali Rai(1).\\nThat case in our opinion has no application to the facts of this case because that case dealt with an application under section 33 of the Industrial Disputes Act while the present proceedings are under section 10 of the Act and the considerations which apply under section 33 are different in many respects from those which apply to an adjudication under section 10.\\nThe appeal therefore fails and is hereby dismissed with costs.\\nAppeal dismissed.   \n",

Text: This case concerns the circumstances in which under EU law a finding in a judicial decision by an EU court is binding in later judicial proceedings.\\nThe EU principle of res judicata, which applies directly in a domestic court of a member state when dealing with a dispute falling within the scope of EU law, has a number of strands.\\nOne is known as relative res judicata and applies where a second action is brought between the same parties, dealing with the same subject matter and based on the same grounds as an earlier action.\\nHowever, this case concerns a distinct strand known as absolute res judicata or, to use its full Latin tag, res judicata erga omnes.\\nThis is intended to convey that, where the principle applies, a judicial decision is given dispositive effect which is binding not simply on the parties to the decision but on all the world.\\nIt is a principle of EU law which has been developed by the EU courts in recent decades in a specific context for a specific purpose which relates to the effective judicial control of EU institutions and the maintenance of the EU legal order.\\nIt concerns the binding scope of a judgment of the General Court of the European Union (the General Court) or the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) annulling a measure adopted by an EU institution.\\nIn addressing its scope and applicability it is therefore necessary to set to one side distinct notions of res judicata, issue estoppel and abuse of process as understood in common law jurisdictions.\\nThe factual background\\nThe appellants (referred to collectively as Servier), who are defendants in each of the proceedings giving rise to this appeal, developed and manufactured the medicinal product perindopril erbumine (Perindopril), which is used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases including the treatment of high blood pressure.\\nThey marketed Perindopril under the trade name Coversyl.\\nPerindopril falls within the class of medicines known as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors).\\nServier obtained a number of patents for Perindopril during the course of its development.\\nThe respondents to this appeal (referred to collectively as the claimants), are the national health authorities of England, Wales, and Scotland and Northern Ireland.\\nThey are the claimants in the national proceedings.\\nThe High Court has directed that the three sets of proceedings be jointly managed and be tried on the same occasion (Order of Henderson J dated 26 February 2016).\\nThe present appeal is against the order of the Court of Appeal dated 27 June 2019 that followed a one day hearing on 18 June 2019 ([2019] EWCA Civ 1096; [2020] Ch 193).\\nThat order dismissed Serviers appeal from the order of Roth J at first instance dated 17 April 2019, following a two day hearing on 6 7 March 2019 ([2019] EWHC 1004 (Ch); [2019] 5 CMLR 6).\\nThe national proceedings\\nThe national proceedings were commenced by the claimants between May 2011 and September 2012.\\nIn those proceedings, each of the claimants alleged: (1) breaches by Servier of article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and/or the Chapter 1 prohibition under the Competition Act 1998 (the 1998 Act), consisting in the conclusion of anticompetitive agreements between Servier and potential manufacturers and/or suppliers of generic Perindopril, under which the generic manufacturers/suppliers would stay out of the market in return for financial consideration; and (2) an abuse of a dominant position by Servier contrary to article 102 TFEU and/or the Chapter 2 prohibition under the 1998 Act consisting in: (a) the obtaining, defending and enforcing of an invalid patent through the provision of misleading information to patent authorities and/or courts; and (b) the adoption of an exclusionary strategy, designed to keep competitors off the market, by entering into anticompetitive agreements with generic manufacturers and/or suppliers (as above), and by purchasing rights to an alternative means of manufacturing Perindopril developed by a company known as Azad.\\nIn addition, the English claimants alone pleaded a further claim for the tort of causing loss by unlawful means, based on largely the same facts as the alleged patent abuse.\\nFollowing the striking out of that claim ([2019] EWCA Civ 1160; [2019] 3 WLR 938), the claims are essentially identical across all three sets of proceedings.\\nThe English claimants appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal to uphold the strike out of that cause of action is pending before the Supreme Court.\\nThe claimants allege that by reason of Serviers unlawful conduct, the entry of generic Perindopril onto the UK market was delayed, which caused the price of Perindopril to be higher than it otherwise would have been.\\nThe claimants allege that as a result they have suffered substantial financial loss through the higher prices they have paid for Serviers Perindopril product.\\nIn October 2016, Servier was granted permission by Henderson J to amend its pleadings to include defences to the effect that if liability and causation are established then the claimants damages should be reduced or extinguished (i) because the claimants failed to mitigate their losses, (ii) for contributory negligence or (iii) because the losses claimed are too remote: [2016] EWHC 2381 (Ch); [2016] 5 CMLR 25.\\nThese defences are described collectively and for convenience as the prescribing argument.\\nThe Commission proceedings\\nIn 2009 the European Commission (the Commission) commenced an investigation in case COMP/39.612 into whether Serviers conduct relating to Perindopril had the object or effect of hindering generic entry of Perindopril on European Economic Area (EEA) markets.\\nThe Commission granted interested party status to the English claimants for the purpose of the administrative stage of the proceedings.\\nThis entailed: (i) access to a confidential 16 page summary of the Statement of Objections but not access to any of the evidence, submissions or other documents on the Commissions file (after the Commission proceedings had concluded, access was granted to relevant documents from the Commissions file in the disclosure exercise in the national proceedings); (ii) the opportunity, which was taken, to make submissions in writing; and (iii) the opportunity, which was taken, to attend the oral hearing and make 30 minutes oral submissions.\\nThe other claimants did not request to be and were not interested parties in the proceedings before the Commission.\\nOn 9 July 2014, the Commission issued a decision finding that Servier contravened articles 101 and 102 TFEU and imposing fines (the Commission Decision).\\nThose aspects of the Commission Decision concerning article 102 are most relevant to the present appeal.\\nIn particular, in determining that Servier held a dominant position in a relevant market (an element of the finding of breach of article 102 TFEU), the Commission defined the relevant market as comprising only Perindopril and it rejected Serviers argument that it comprised, at least, all ACE inhibitors.\\nAfter obtaining disclosure of the Commission Decision on 9 March 2015, the claimants in all three sets of proceedings introduced amendments to their particulars of claim to rely on the Commission Decision, including in relation to the definition of the relevant market.\\nServiers Appeal against the Commission Decision and the General Court Judgment\\nOn 21 September 2014, Servier applied to the General Court in Case T 691/14 seeking the annulment of the Commission Decision.\\nServier relied on 17 pleas in support of its application, including the 14th plea which was summarised as follows: the Commission wrongly and artificially restricted the relevant market for finished products to the single molecule of perindopril, by excluding the 15 other enzyme conversion inhibitors available on the market.\\nThe claimants did not apply to intervene and they were not involved in the General Court proceedings.\\nThe General Court gave its judgment on 12 December 2018 (Case T 691/14) EU:T:2018:922 (the General Court Judgment).\\nIn it, the General Court: (1) annulled one of the findings of infringement of article 101 TFEU (in relation to the settlement agreement between Krka (Krka Tovarna Zdravil dd is a Slovenian pharmaceutical company which had, with a number of other pharmaceutical companies, filed opposition proceedings before the European Patent Office against one of Serviers patents) and Servier), but upheld the remainder of the Commissions findings of infringement of article 101 TFEU; and (2) annulled the finding of infringement of article 102 TFEU in its entirety, on the grounds that the relevant market at the relevant time extended beyond Perindopril and Servier did not have a dominant position in that wider market.\\nBoth the Commission and Servier have now appealed from the General Court Judgment to the CJEU: see pending cases C 201/19P and C 176/19P.\\nThe UK Government has been granted permission to intervene in those appeals.\\nThe Commission is challenging (i) the General Courts approach to market definition including the General Courts analysis of the considerations of therapeutic substitutability and (ii) the determination that the Krka Agreement was not in breach of article 101 TFEU.\\nThere are significant overlaps between the allegations of infringement in the national proceedings and the infringements investigated and found by the Commission.\\nAs a result, it is common ground that the domestic proceedings cannot proceed to a final trial until the Commission proceedings and appeals therefrom have been finally resolved at EU level.\\nThe prescribing argument\\nThe prescribing argument relies (inter alia) on factual contentions that (a) ACE inhibitors exert a class effect (meaning that all drugs in the class work in essentially the same way and produce essentially the same effects) and (b) that there was no clinical difference between Perindopril and alternative ACE inhibitors that should have been material to NHS prescribers choice between ACE inhibitors, or to the claimants decision as to whether to encourage switching to other ACE inhibitors already available in generic form.\\nOn the basis of those factual contentions, Servier pleads further that NHS prescribers could therefore prescribe these ACE inhibitors as an alternative to Perindopril and the claimants should therefore have taken all reasonable steps to encourage switching from the prescription of Perindopril to the prescription of cheaper alternative ACE inhibitors in generic form.\\nParagraph 83C of Serviers re re amended defence to the English claimants claim sets out the particular steps which Servier contends the claimants should have taken to encourage prescribers to prescribe cheaper alternative ACE inhibitors that, unlike Perindopril, were already available in generic form during the relevant period.\\nOn 31 January 2018, Roth J ordered that there should be a nine day trial of a set of preliminary issues in relation to the prescribing argument.\\nThe early determination of these issues was intended to be useful because it could eliminate or substantially reduce the costs of a disclosure exercise relating to the prescribing argument.\\nOn 8 November 2018, the trial estimate for the preliminary issues was extended to 22 days and the trial was relisted for October 2019.\\nRoth J indicated that the preliminary issues trial should not take place before the General Court had issued its judgment, which it had not yet done at that time.\\nThe preliminary issues ordered to be tried, as subsequently amended, were: (1) Would it have been reasonable or appropriate in the period between 2003 and 2009 for a clinician to prescribe another ACE inhibitor instead of Perindopril in all circumstances, except where the patient was allergic to or intolerant of all alternative ACE inhibitors? (2) inappropriate? If not, in what circumstances would that have been unreasonable or (3) Was it unreasonable for the claimants to fail to take any (and if so, which) of the steps set out in paragraph 83C of Serviers re re amended defence to the English claimants claim or identified in Serviers Further Information dated 29 September 2017?\\nThe General Court having delivered its judgment on 12 December 2018, Servier indicated that its position was that certain findings made by the General Court (in particular as to the substitutability of Perindopril with other ACE inhibitors) would be binding on the High Court in the trial of the preliminary issues.\\nOn 18 January 2019, Roth J directed the parties to serve pleadings on the question of the extent to which findings of fact made in the General Court Judgment that also arise for determination in the preliminary issue trial of the prescribing argument are binding in that trial.\\nOn 1 February 2019, Servier served its pleading setting out eight propositions of fact derived from the General Court Judgment on which it intended to rely as binding in the trial of the preliminary issues.\\nThese propositions were: (1) There was no significant difference between Perindopril and other ACE inhibitors in therapeutic terms, including in terms of efficacy and side effects, mode of action, main indications and contra indications (General Court Judgment paras 1425, 1429, 1481, 1519, 1589). (2) ACE inhibitors were widely perceived as substitutable by prescribers and there were many medications considered by physicians as therapeutic equivalents to Perindopril (General Court Judgment paras 1481, 1489). (3) There were no reasons why physicians should not have prescribed ACE inhibitors other than Perindopril for new patients (General Court Judgment para 1489). (4) Switching between ACE inhibitors for existing patients did not raise particular fears on the part of physicians (General Court Judgment para 1519). (5) The prescribing behaviour of physicians was not characterised by a high degree of inertia and treatment changes in patients undergoing continuous treatment were significant (General Court Judgment para 1544). (6) At least some Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) considered, as from 2005, that Perindopril was no more effective than any other ACE inhibitor and recommended, for cost reasons, the use of other ACE inhibitors than Perindopril, or even the substitution of another ACE inhibitor for Perindopril, in particular lisinopril or ramipril (General Court Judgment para 1464). (7) At least some PCT policies had a real negative effect on Perindopril sales at local level (General Court Judgment para 1534). (8) Serviers promotional activities did not sufficiently differentiate Perindopril from other ACE inhibitors for it to be recognised for particular therapeutic qualities by physicians (General Court Judgment paras 1472, 1473).\\nServier contended that in so far as those propositions were findings made in the General Court Judgment, they were binding in the preliminary trial for two reasons: (1) the EU law principle of res judicata renders findings of fact and law constituting the ratio of an annulling judgment of the General Court binding erga omnes with absolute effect; and (2) in all of the circumstances of the case, including the claimants ability to participate in the EU proceedings (through the UK state) and their own positive reliance on the Commissions findings in relation to the prescribing argument, it would be an abuse of process for the claimants to require Servier to relitigate those factual issues in the mitigation trial.\\nThe claimants admitted as facts the propositions stated at (6) and (7) in para 19 above, so the question of whether those findings were binding did not arise for consideration by Roth J.\\nThe claimants denied, however, that the principle of res judicata confers binding effect in respect of the other findings of fact relied on by Servier in these proceedings, and denied that there would be an abuse of process as alleged or at all.\\nIn his judgment Roth J addressed (at para 51) the question of whether the six disputed propositions were actually found as facts in the General Court Judgment.\\nHe concluded that: (1) propositions (1) to (3) were findings made in the General Court Judgment; (2) proposition (5) was only made in modified form, to the effect that the Commission had not established that the prescribing behaviour of physicians was characterised by a high degree of inertia, and treatment changes in patients undergoing continuous treatment were significant; and (3) propositions (4) and (8) were not findings made in the General Court Judgment.\\nIn his judgment, Roth J held that none of the findings of fact constituted res judicata for the purposes of the preliminary issues trial, and that it was not an abuse of process for the claimants to advance arguments and adduce evidence at the preliminary issues trial contrary to the propositions set out by Servier.\\nRoth J granted permission to appeal in respect of Serviers res judicata pleading on the grounds that the question of how the EU principle of res judicata applies in this context had not been decided before and raised an important issue on which Servier had a reasonable prospect of success.\\nIn addition, Servier sought permission first from Roth J, and then from the Court of Appeal, on the questions of (i) whether propositions (4), (5) and (8) had been found as facts in the General Court Judgment, and (ii) on the question of abuse of process.\\nPermission to appeal was refused on these further grounds.\\nOn 18 June 2019, the Court of Appeal heard the expedited appeal from Roth J in relation to the issue of res judicata.\\nOn 27 June 2019 the Court of Appeal delivered its judgment ([2020] Ch 193), in which it held that none of the findings of fact relied on by Servier constituted res judicata for the purposes of the preliminary issues hearing.\\nIt refused permission to appeal to the Supreme Court.\\nOn 25 July 2019, the Supreme Court granted Servier permission to appeal on the issue of res judicata, solely on the basis that the application involved a point of law which is arguably not acte clair.\\nOn 26 July 2019, at the pre trial review in relation to the preliminary issues hearing, with the consent of the parties, Roth J vacated the October 2019 preliminary issues hearing pending determination of this appeal to the Supreme Court.\\nIssues on this appeal\\nOn this appeal, the Supreme Court is asked to determine whether the following findings of fact made by the General Court are binding on the national court in a trial of preliminary issues under the EU principle of res judicata: the finding that there was no significant difference between (1) Perindopril and other ACE inhibitors in therapeutic terms, including in terms of efficacy and side effects, mode of action, main indications and contra indications (paras 1425, 1429, 1481, 1519 and 1589 of the General Court Judgment); the finding that ACE inhibitors were widely perceived as substitutable (2) by prescribers and there were many medications considered by physicians as therapeutic equivalents to Perindopril: (paras 1481 and 1489 of the General Court Judgment); (3) the finding that there was no element that limited the discretion available to physicians to prescribe ACE inhibitors other than Perindopril for new patients (para 1489 of the General Court Judgment); and the findings: (i) that the Commission had not established that the (4) prescribing behaviour of physicians was characterised by a high degree of inertia; and (ii) treatment changes in patients undergoing continuous treatment were significant (paras 1540 and 1544 of the General Court Judgment).\\nServier contends that the appeal raises a point of EU law that cannot be characterised as acte clair against Servier.\\nBy contrast, the claimants contend that the point of law is acte clair and that the High Court and Court of Appeal reached the right conclusion.\\nIf the Supreme Court agrees with Servier that this issue is not acte clair against it, the Supreme Court is asked to refer   \n",
                            "7817  Summarize this legal case and explain any terms. Text: This appeal is sensitive and important.\\nI regret that I have failed to contain this judgment within fewer than 78 paragraphs, plus 25 paragraphs of a schedule to it.\\nThe Court of Appeal has made a rare finding that the judges conduct of the trial was unfair towards one of the parties.\\nWhen made in respect of the conduct of any judge, however senior or junior, such a finding carries profound sensitivity.\\nOur duty is to appraise it with the utmost care; and, were we to uphold it, we would need to address the order made by the Court of Appeal in consequence of it.\\nBut there is a second dimension to the appeal to this court.\\nFor the Court of Appeal also based its decision upon its understanding of the effect of section 4 of the Defamation Act 2013 (the Act), entitled Publication on matter of public interest; and energetic criticisms are made to us in relation to its exposition of the effect of the section.\\nFor reasons which will become apparent, our own analysis of the section will not form part of our decision; but it is intended to be helpful nevertheless.\\nIt will be convenient to describe the appellants as the defendants; and the respondent as the claimant.\\nThe first defendant, Mr Malkiewicz, is the editor in chief of a Polish newspaper, entitled Nowy Czas (which means New Time) and owned by the second defendant, Czas Publishers Ltd. The third defendant, Mrs Bazarnik Malkiewicz, is an editor of the paper, a director of the second defendant and the wife of the first defendant.\\nAt the relevant time the paper was published eight times a year, both in hard copy and online, and it addresses issues of interest to the substantial Polish community in the UK, particularly in London.\\nThe claimant, Mr Serafin, now aged about 68, was born in Poland but has lived in England since 1984.\\nThe claimant sued the defendants for libel in respect of an article which they published about him in the newspaper in October 2015.\\nOver seven days in October and November 2017 Mr Justice Jay (the judge), sitting in the Queens Bench Division of the High Court, heard the claim.\\nThe claimant appeared in person before him, supported by a McKenzie friend.\\nSimon Burn Solicitors had been acting for him but came off the record shortly before the hearing.\\nIt appears, however, that, outside court, a degree of legal assistance was continuing to be provided to the claimant during the hearing, in particular in relation to the compilation of his closing submissions.\\nBut ranged against the claimant in court was Mr Metzer QC, by then instructed directly by the defendants rather than by the solicitors who had acted for them until shortly before the hearing.\\nBy a reserved judgment dated 24 November 2017, the judge explained why he had decided to dismiss the claim: [2017] EWHC 2992 (QB).\\nOn 8 December 2017 he made an order to that effect.\\nThe claimant appealed against it to the Court of Appeal.\\nOn 5 March 2019 Lewison, McCombe and Haddon Cave LJJ heard the appeal.\\nBy a judgment of the whole court dated 17 May 2019, they explained why they had decided to allow the appeal: [2019] EWCA Civ 852.\\nOn 21 June 2019 they made an order to that effect.\\nThey remitted the task of quantifying the claimants damages in respect of part or all of his claim to a judge of the Media and Communications List other than the judge.\\nThe defendants now appeal to this court against that order.\\nB. The Background\\nFollowing his arrival in England, the claimant set up business as a builder.\\nIn about 1989 he joined POSK, a substantial Polish social and cultural association, established as a charity, with premises in Hammersmith.\\nFor about 15 years until 2012 he sat on the General Council of POSK and between about 2003 and 2007 he was a senior member of its House Committee, which was responsible for all building work done at the premises.\\nDuring his membership of it there was refurbishment both of the entrance hall and of the basement, where a bar and caf, together called The Jazz Caf, were created.\\nBetween 2007 and 2012 the claimant was joint manager of The Jazz Caf and often served behind the bar.\\nIn 2008 the claimant set up a company, Polfood (UK) Ltd, with a view to its importing Polish foodstuffs and selling them wholesale to Polish groceries in England.\\nThe company needed working capital and the claimant persuaded Polish friends and acquaintances to buy shares in it or to lend money either to it or to him for transmission to it.\\nBut Polfood soon became insolvent.\\nIn 2011 the claimant was declared bankrupt.\\nIn 2012 he was discharged but only in consideration of his entry into a Bankruptcy Restrictions Undertaking, which was to endure for five years.\\nHe thereby apparently undertook not to be a director of a company without the courts permission, not to borrow more than 500 without disclosing the restriction and not to be a trustee of a charity.\\nKolbe House is the name of a charity which runs a substantial care home in Ealing.\\nIt provides care for elderly Polish people.\\nWhile it was trading, Polfood supplied bread and other foodstuffs to Kolbe House.\\nIn 2012 the claimant began again to supply it with bread.\\nIn 2013 he became the maintenance man and general factotum at Kolbe House; and he invoiced it for works of renovation done by him there.\\nThe Meanings of the Article\\nThe article, written of course in the Polish language, is entitled Bankruptcy need not be painful.\\nAt its foot is the name of the first defendant, whom the judge described as a Polish intellectual in the old school.\\nThe judge described the article as satirical, witty, allusive and intellectually sophisticated in style and tone.\\nThe claimant alleged that the words of the article had in effect 13 defamatory meanings (or, to use the word in the Act, imputations).\\nThe defendants responded that the words bore a common sting, which was that the claimant was a bankrupt and a serially untrustworthy man who, in order to satisfy his ambition and financially benefit himself and his family in Poland, took improper advantage of a number of people, including women.\\nThe judge disagreed that the words bore this common sting and held that he was therefore required to address whether the defendants were liable for each of the 13 meanings which, insofar as they admitted them, were as alleged by the claimant and which, insofar as they disputed those alleged by the claimant, were those which he found the article to have carried.\\nThe first meaning (M1) was that the claimant abused his position as house manager of POSK in order to award himself or his company profitable contracts for maintenance work at POSK, avoiding the proper procedure for obtaining approval for tenders for such contracts.\\nThe defendants appear to have contended that, if the article bore this meaning, it was not defamatory by reason of section 1(1) of the Act, which provides as follows: A statement is not defamatory unless its publication has caused or is likely to cause serious harm to the reputation of the claimant.\\nThe judge rejected the defendants contention.\\nHe proceeded, however, to consider an alternative contention of the defendants, namely that they had a defence under section 2(1) of the Act, which provides as follows: It is a defence to an action for defamation for the defendant to show that the imputation conveyed by the statement complained of is substantially true.\\nThe judge found that M1 had been shown to be substantially true.\\nThe second meaning (M2) was that the claimant purchased memberships of POSK for those whom he could rely upon to support his electoral aspirations.\\nThe judge found that, even if, which he doubted, the publication of a statement to this effect crossed the threshold of serious harm to reputation set by section 1 of the Act, M2 had been shown to be substantially true.\\nThe third meaning (M3) was that the claimant was not really single at all, or at the very least his personal circumstances in Poland were mysterious and that he exploited his supposed availability as a means of bringing him closer to women, over whom he exercised his charm.\\nAs in relation to the second meaning, the judge found that even if, which he doubted, the publication of a statement to this effect crossed the threshold of serious harm set by section 1 of the Act, M3 had been shown to be substantially true.\\nThe fourth meaning (M4) was that the claimant in the course of supplying alcohol for retail sale in POSKs Jazz Caf, dishonestly ensured that money taken from sales would by pass the cash register, in order to obtain unlawful and fraudulent profit from those sales.\\nThe judge found that the statement to this effect had been shown to be substantially true.\\nThe fifth meaning (M5) was that the claimant conned a number of women into investing their life savings into his food business by leading each woman to believe she was the only one and with promises of a good life together with him.\\nThe judge found that the statement to this effect had been shown to be substantially true.\\nThe sixth meaning (M6) was that the claimant having dishonestly persuaded investors in his food business to part with their life savings, stole their money for himself and transferred it to Poland to support a family construction project in Poland and to support his family there.\\nThe judge found that the statement to this effect had been shown to be substantially true.\\nThe seventh meaning (M7) was that the claimant defrauded his creditors and dishonestly circumvented the normal consequences of bankruptcy in order to retain for himself personal wealth, in the form of a BMW X5 car and real property that he pretended to sell, that should have been made available to satisfy the claims of his creditors.\\nThe judge found that the statement to this effect had been shown to be substantially true.\\nThe eighth meaning (M8) was that the claimant had profited or attempted to profit by selling out of date food to Kolbe House, a residential care home for elderly and vulnerable people, including those suffering from dementia.\\nThe judge found that the defendants had failed to show that the statement to this effect was substantially true.\\nThe ninth meaning (M9) was that the claimant by means of exploiting his charm and sway over the female manager of Kolbe House, inveigled himself into the highest levels of management at the home to the extent that he treated it as if it were his own personal property, including accessing at will the highly confidential records of the vulnerable residents despite having no legitimate reason to do so.\\nThe judge found that the defendants had failed to show that the statement to this effect was substantially true.\\nThe tenth meaning (M10) was that the claimant abused his position of trust at Kolbe House and callously diverted to himself funds that were needed for the care of the homes elderly and sick residents by securing for himself a contract for the major renovation of the bathrooms at the home, even though these renovations were completely unnecessary.\\nThe judge found that the defendants had failed to show that the statement to this effect was substantially true.\\nThere is inconsistency in the judges judgment about what he found to be the 11th meaning (M11).\\nBut it appears to have been that the claimant supplied to Kolbe House frozen milk and bread which was close to its sell by date from a source which he did not disclose.\\nThe judge found that the statement to this effect failed to cross the threshold of serious harm to reputation set by section 1 of the Act.\\nThe 12th meaning (M12) was that the claimant dishonestly concealed from the manager and trustees of Kolbe House his current status as an undischarged bankrupt in order to win their trust and also to obtain a building contract for the extension of the managers home.\\nThe judge rejected the assertion of the defendants that the statement to this effect failed to cross the threshold of serious harm to reputation set by section 1 of the Act and he proceeded to find that they had also failed to show that it was substantially true.\\nThe 13th meaning (M13) was that the claimant concealed his bankrupt status from Ealing Council [in relation to a planning application] in circumstances where he was obliged to reveal it.\\nThe judge found that the defendants had failed to show that the statement to this effect was substantially true.\\nIt follows that, by this stage of the judges judgment, the claimants cause of action had been rejected in relation to all the meanings apart from M8, M9, M10, M12 and M13.\\nThese five meanings all related, directly or indirectly, to Kolbe House.\\nThen, however, the judge turned to address a further defence raised by the defendants in relation to all 13 meanings, thus relevantly including the five meanings which had until that stage of his judgment survived as actionable.\\nThis was the defence under section 4 of the Act.\\nD. Public Interest\\nSection 4, entitled Publication on matter of public interest, is more conveniently set out in para 52 below.\\nMuch of the argument before the judge in relation to section 4 surrounded subsection (1)(b), namely whether the defendants could show, particularly in circumstances in which they had not invited the claimant to comment prior to publication on their intended allegations against him, that it was reasonable for them to have believed that publishing the statements was in the public interest.\\nIn the event the judge found that the defendants had indeed established a defence under section 4 in relation to all the allegations and thus, relevantly, to the five meanings of them which had until that stage survived as actionable.\\nThe judge added, however, that, even if the defence under section 4 had not been established, he would not have awarded damages (other, presumably, than nominal damages) in respect of those five meanings.\\nFor, so he explained, the claimants reputation had been sufficiently shot to pieces by the other statements in the article which had been shown to be substantially true.\\nSo the judge dismissed the claim.\\nThe Appeal to the Court of Appeal\\nFor his appeal the claimant re instructed Simon Burn Solicitors.\\nThe claimants grounds of appeal were (a) that the judge had been wrong to uphold the defence under section 4; (b) that there was no evidence on which he could have found that M4 was substantially true and that, without reference to that finding, he could not have found that the claimants reputation had been shot to pieces by reference only to the other imputations shown to have been substantially true; and that the judges conduct of the hearing had been unfair to the claimant. (c)\\nBefore the Court of Appeal Ms Marzec appeared for the claimant and, as before, Mr Metzer appeared for the defendants.\\nThe court chose to address the grounds of appeal in the order set out by the claimant.\\nIt held, first, at para 84 that the judge had been wrong to uphold the defence under section 4.\\nIt held, second, at para 99 that on the evidence before him he had not been entitled to find that M4 was substantially true and so it set that finding aside.\\nThen, suggesting that M4 had been the most serious imputation made against him, it proceeded at para 101 to uphold the claimants contention that it would not have been open to the judge to find that his reputation had been shot to pieces by reference only to the other imputations shown to have been substantially true.\\nAt that stage of the judgment and (as it said) on this basis, the Court of Appeal explained at para 102 that the claimant was entitled to damages in respect not only of M8, M9, M10, M12 and M13 but therefore also of M4.\\nThe Court of Appeal then addressed the claimants third ground of appeal, namely that the judges conduct of the hearing had been unfair to him.\\nThe court was furnished with substantial parts of the transcripts of the first four days of the hearing and with 16 short excerpts from them on which Ms Marzec particularly relied.\\nThe court concluded at para 114 that on numerous occasions the judge had appeared to descend into the arena, to cast off the mantle of impartiality, to take up the cudgels of cross examination and to use language which was threatening and bullying; and that its impression was of a judge who, if not partisan, had developed an animus towards the claimant.\\nIt observed at para 117 that it found his conduct all the more surprising in light of the fact that the claimant was appearing in person and that, although he spoke it well, English was not his first language.\\nIt added at para 118 that it was highly troubled by the judges criticisms of the claimants disclosure of particular documents in circumstances in which the defendants had at no time sought an order for their disclosure.\\nThe court concluded as follows at para 119: In our view, the judge not only seriously transgressed the core principle that a judge remains neutral during the evidence, but he also acted in a manner which was, at times, manifestly unfair and hostile to the claimant [W]e are driven to the conclusion that the nature, tenor and frequency of the judges interventions were such as to render this libel trial unfair.\\nWe, therefore, uphold [this] ground of appeal.\\nThe Court of Appeals Order F.\\nThe problem is that the Court of Appeal did not in its judgment proceed to address the consequences that should flow from its conclusion that the trial had been unfair.\\nIn particular it did not consider whether that conclusion should in any way displace its earlier conclusion, set out in para 31 above, about the relief to which the claimant was entitled.\\nAt the end of its judgment the court said only that the appeal should be allowed; and, apparently by email, it invited the parties to file written submissions in respect of the appropriate order to be made in the light of its judgment.\\nThe transcript of the hearing before the Court of Appeal shows that both parties had then reluctantly accepted, as apparently had the court, that, were it to conclude that the trial had been unfair, it would have no option but to order a retrial of the claim.\\nThe written submissions of the parties to the court following distribution of its judgment show only limited departure from that position.\\nThus the claimants basic contention was that the judgment no longer stands because the trial was unfair and that the claim should be remitted for determination by another judge.\\nBut the claimant qualified his contention by reference to two points: he argued that, in the light of the courts judgment, the pleas in the Defence under section 4 of the Act and, in relation to M4, that it was substantially true should both be struck out of it.\\nThe defendants agreed with the claimants basic contention that there should be a retrial; they argued that all issues that were alive on the statements of case at the trial should remain alive at the retrial save to the extent that the judgment of the Court of Appeal had finally determined them.\\nIn this latter regard they conceded, no doubt subject to their proposed appeal to our court, that the judgment had finally rejected their defence in relation to public interest and that it should be struck out of their Defence; but they disputed that the judgment had finally rejected their contention that M4 was substantially true.\\nthe following order: In the event, however, the Court of Appeal, without giving reasons, issued 1.\\nThere be judgment for the appellant. 2.\\nThe orders of Mr Justice Jay . be set aside. 5.\\nThe matter shall be remitted for an assessment of the quantum of the claimants damages only, by a Judge of the Media and Communications List [other than Jay J].\\nIt follows that the Court of Appeal did not order a retrial.\\nIt ordered a remittal limited to the assessment of damages.\\nAt the hearing before us we asked counsel on both sides what each understood the courts order to mean.\\nDid it mean, particularly in the light of the order for judgment for the claimant, that the liability of the defendants was established in relation to all the mean   \n",
                            "7818                Summarize this legal case and explain any terms. Text: This appeal is concerned with the obligations under the Equality Act 2010 of a charity which has been set up to provide housing in Stamford Hill in Hackney for a disadvantaged group, the observant Orthodox Jewish community comprising, in particular, the Haredi community.\\nThe charity is the second respondent, Agudas Israel Housing Association Ltd (AIHA).\\nIts charitable objective is to make social housing available primarily for members of the Orthodox Jewish community.\\nSuch is the surplus of demand for social housing from the members of that community, as compared with the properties which AIHA has available, that in practice all of AIHAs properties are allocated to members of the Orthodox Jewish community.\\nThe first respondent is a local housing authority, Hackney London Borough Council (the Council).\\nAIHA makes properties available to the Council, as they become vacant, to house persons who have applied to the Council for social housing and who have been identified by the Council as having a priority need for such housing.\\nThe properties provided by AIHA constitute about 1% of the stock of social housing available to the Council.\\nIn relation to the Council, there is a large surplus of demand for social housing as compared with the supply available, so applicants for social housing can spend long periods waiting for suitable properties to become available.\\nThe Council does not have any right to compel AIHA to take tenants who do not fall within the scope of AIHAs charitable objective and its selection criteria.\\nThe Council therefore nominates applicants for social housing with AIHA who fall within those criteria.\\nIn practice, this means that the Council only nominates members of the Orthodox Jewish community to be housed in property owned by AIHA.\\nThe principal appellant (the appellant) is a single mother with four small children: twin daughters and two sons, both of whom have autism and one of whom is also a party to the proceedings.\\nShe was on the Councils list for social housing and had been identified by the Council as having priority need to be housed in a larger property.\\nShe is not from the Orthodox Jewish community and so has been unable to gain access to the properties let by AIHA.\\nWhile the appellant was waiting to be allocated a suitable property by the Council, large properties owned by AIHA which would have been suitable for her became vacant and were allocated by AIHA to families from the Orthodox Jewish community who had also been identified by the Council as having priority needs.\\nThe appellant had to wait longer than them to be allocated a suitable property by the Council from its other social housing resources, as they became available.\\nThe appellant commenced proceedings against the Council and AIHA in 2018 complaining that this involved unlawful conduct on their part in various respects.\\nIn particular, she complains that there has been unlawful direct discrimination against her on grounds of her religion and on grounds of her race.\\nHer claim was dismissed by the Divisional Court (Lindblom LJ and Sir Kenneth Parker) in a judgment dated 4 February 2019: [2019] EWHC 139 (Admin); [2019] PTSR 985.\\nHer appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal (Lewison and King LJJ and Sir Stephen Richards) in a judgment dated 27 June 2019: [2019] EWCA Civ 1099; [2019] PTSR 2272.\\nIn the course of the proceedings, the appellants claims have been somewhat\\nrefined.\\nFor the purposes of the appeal to this court, the issues to be decided relate to the lawfulness of the conduct of AIHA.\\nThe Council accepts that if AIHA engaged in unlawful discrimination against the appellant by its allocation policy, then the Council cannot lawfully maintain its nomination arrangements with AIHA.\\nBut there is no distinct legal claim against the Council which does not turn upon the underlying substantive question of whether AIHA acted lawfully or not.\\nAccordingly, in what follows, the focus is entirely on the claims against AIHA.\\nThe relevant claims brought by the appellant against AIHA were based on the prohibition of direct discrimination on grounds of race or religion by any person in the provision of services, as contained in the Equality Act 2010 (the 2010 Act).\\nAIHA relied on defences set out in section 158 and section 193 of the 2010 Act.\\nSection 158 provides for an exemption from unlawfulness for positive action to address needs or disadvantages experienced by persons which are connected to a protected characteristic.\\nSection 193 provides an exemption for the activities of charities under defined conditions.\\nAIHA accepts that it distinguishes between applicants for its housing on the grounds of religion and that, subject to the statutory defences, this would constitute unlawful direct discrimination contrary to the relevant provisions of the 2010 Act.\\nAIHA denies that it discriminates between applicants on grounds of their race.\\nMr Ian Wise QC, for the appellant, in his skeleton argument for the hearing in the Divisional Court, indicated to the court that since discrimination on grounds of religion was admitted by AIHA, it might be unnecessary to decide if AIHA discriminated on grounds of race.\\nThe Divisional Court took Mr Wise at his word and focused its analysis on the appellants claim of unlawful discrimination on grounds of religion.\\nIt made no finding as to whether there was discrimination on grounds of race. (This is subject to one narrow point which the Divisional Court did deal with, which is no longer a live issue between the parties: the court dealt with a submission on the part of the appellant to the effect that AIHA was not entitled to rely on a defence under section 193 of the 2010 Act by reason of section 194(2) of that Act.\\nSection 194(2) provides that a charity may not avail itself of a defence under section 193 if it discriminates on grounds of race, in the sense of colour.\\nThe Divisional Court found that AIHA does not discriminate between applicants for housing on grounds of colour and by the time of the hearings in the Court of Appeal and in this court this was common ground.)\\nAlthough the Divisional Court had been invited by Mr Wise not to deal with the allegation of discrimination on grounds of race if it was unnecessary to do so and hence did not make findings about that part of the case, on the appellants appeal to the Court of Appeal this was made into a point of criticism.\\nFurther, for the first time in his reply skeleton argument in the Court of Appeal, Mr Wise referred to Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (the Race Directive).\\nAt that stage, the Race Directive was relied on as a potential aid to interpretation of section 193 of the 2010 Act.\\nThis was not on the footing that the appellant had rights under it as against AIHA on the findings made by the Divisional Court (which involved only discrimination on grounds of religion, which does not fall within the scope of the Race Directive), but on the basis that others might have rights under the Directive where there was discrimination on grounds of race and that these rights ought to be reflected in the interpretation of section 193, by virtue of the principle of sympathetic construction of national legislation articulated by the European Court of Justice (now the Court of Justice of the European Union: I will refer to it as the CJEU in both phases of its existence) in Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional De Alimentacion SA (Case C 106/89) [1990] ECR I 4135; [1992] 1 CMLR 305 (Marleasing).\\nThe Court of Appeal rejected this argument (para 54).\\nSince the appellant could not show that she had suffered discrimination on grounds of race within the scope of the Race Directive, she could not benefit from the special interpretive obligation arising from the Marleasing case.\\nSimilarly, since the appellant had not shown that her case fell within the scope of EU law, she could not rely on the right against discrimination set out in article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the CFR).\\nOn the appeal to this court, the appellants position shifted again.\\nAt the hearing, Mr Wise applied to the court for permission to introduce a new argument for the appellant.\\nAccording to this argument, Mr Wise invites the court to find that the appellant was in fact affected by direct discrimination by AIHA on grounds of race or ethnic origin, contrary to the Race Directive.\\nHe submits that the appellant was subject to direct discrimination on grounds of ethnic origin which was the same as that found by this court, by a majority, to have occurred in R (E) v Governing Body of JFS (United Synagogue intervening) [2009] UKSC 15; [2010] 2 AC 728 (JFS) in the context of the application of domestic anti discrimination legislation, and that this means that she must be taken to have been subjected to direct discrimination on grounds of race or ethnic origin for the purposes of the Race Directive.\\nOn that basis, Mr Wise submits that either section 193 must be read so as to be compatible with the appellants rights under the Race Directive in accordance with the Marleasing principle of sympathetic construction or, if that cannot be done, it should be disapplied altogether by virtue of the principle of direct effect of EU law.\\nIt is very unusual for this court to grant permission for a wholly new argument to be introduced at this stage.\\nMoreover, since it is a new argument based on a legal instrument (the Race Directive) which was not pleaded by the appellant in her grounds of claim, Mr Wise should have made an application to amend those grounds, which (if allowed) would also have led to AIHA and the Council having the right to amend their grounds of defence to meet the new claim.\\nAs it is, the court was not presented by Mr Wise with any formal or clear statement of the new claim which he wished to introduce.\\nThis was highly unsatisfactory.\\nIt only emerged from the answer given by Mr Wise to a question by the court during his submissions in reply that this new case for the appellant did not involve any complaint of indirect discrimination by AIHA on grounds of race or ethnic origin.\\nAlso, the court did not have the benefit of a formally pleaded defence to the appellants new claim based on the Race Directive, which meant that possible defences had to be explored in submissions without a clear and proper focus.\\nAlso, to state the obvious, the court did not have the benefit of an examination of the new claim and those defences by the lower courts.\\nFurthermore, the appellant should have made a formal application for permission to amend her grounds of claim and to raise the new argument in this court well in advance, rather than leaving it to be raised at the hearing, thereby taking up time which was set aside for the substantive arguments on the appeal.\\nDespite these points, however, Mr Sam Grodzinski QC for AIHA made no strong objection to the introduction of this new case for the appellant at this late stage.\\nHe was confident that he was in a position to meet it without difficulty.\\nMr Matt Hutchings QC for the Council likewise made no strong objection.\\nHaving regard to their position, the court gave provisional permission at the hearing for Mr Wise to develop the new case for the appellant.\\nThe court reserved its position as to the possibility of refusing permission if, after hearing how the argument was developed, it considered that it had been advanced in a way which was unfair to AIHA or the Council.\\nIn the event, given the narrow basis on which Mr Wise sought to develop the new claim based on the Race Directive, the court considers that it is appropriate to confirm the permission given provisionally at the hearing.\\nI will, therefore, address the appellants new claim based on the Race Directive along with her claim based on the 2010 Act.\\nTwo final matters should be mentioned in this introduction.\\nAlthough at an early stage in the proceedings AIHA disputed that it carries out functions which have a sufficient public element to make it amenable to judicial review, it now accepts that it does.\\nBut AIHA does not accept that it is a public authority by virtue of carrying out functions of a public nature within the meaning of section 6(3)(b) of the Human Rights Act 1998 (the HRA).\\nAccordingly, AIHA does not accept that it has any obligation arising under section 6(1) of the HRA to act compatibly with Convention rights of the appellant or other applicants for housing.\\nIn her pleaded case and in her submissions in the Divisional Court and in the Court of Appeal, the appellant did not assert any claim against AIHA under section 6(1) of the HRA on the basis that it was a public authority within the meaning of that Act, and no such issue was included in the agreed Statement of Facts and Issues for the appeal.\\nIn his printed case for the appeal in this court, Mr Wise did include an argument to that effect.\\nHowever, in the event he did not make any application for permission to introduce it, so it is not necessary to say anything about it.\\nThe EU legislative context\\nThe Race Directive enshrines the principle of equal treatment, described in article 2 as meaning that there shall be no direct or indirect discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin.\\nArticle 3 provides that the Directive applies to to all persons, as regards both the public and private sectors in relation to a number of matters, including at article 3(1)(h): access to and supply of goods and services which are available to the public, including housing.\\nRecital (17) to the Race Directive states: The prohibition of discrimination should be without prejudice to the maintenance or adoption of measures intended to prevent or compensate for disadvantages suffered by a group of persons of a particular racial or ethnic origin, and such measures may permit organisations of persons of a particular racial or ethnic origin where their main object is the promotion of the special needs of those persons.\\nArticle 5 makes provision to allow for the objective set out in recital (17), as follows: With a view to ensuring full equality in practice, the principle of equal treatment shall not prevent any member state from maintaining or adopting specific measures to prevent or compensate for disadvantages linked to racial or ethnic origin.\\nArticle 21 of the CFR prohibits any discrimination based on a number of grounds, including race, colour, ethnic or social origin and religion or belief.\\nArticle 51 of the CFR states that it applies to member states only when they are implementing Union law.\\nThe domestic legislative context\\nThe 2010 Act makes various forms of discrimination unlawful.\\nDirect discrimination is defined by section 13(1) of the Act: A person (A) discriminates against another (B) if, because of a protected characteristic, A treats B less favourably than A treats or would treat others.\\nThe relevant protected characteristics are set out in section 4.\\nThey include race and religion or belief.\\nThe meaning of these concepts is explained in sections 9 and 10, respectively.\\nRace includes colour, nationality and ethnic or national origins.\\nBy contrast with the position in relation to indirect discrimination (defined in section 19 of the 2010 Act), there is no general defence of justification in relation to direct discrimination on the basis of these protected characteristics; but so far as is relevant for present purposes, particular defences are set out in sections 158 and 193.\\nService providers and persons exercising public functions are prohibited from discriminating, whether directly or indirectly: section 29.\\nSection 158 is headed Positive action: general.\\nSo far as relevant, it provides: (1) This section applies if a person (P) reasonably thinks that (a) persons who share a protected characteristic suffer a disadvantage connected to the characteristic, (b) persons who share a protected characteristic have needs that are different from the needs of persons who do not share it, or (c) participation in an activity by persons who share a protected characteristic is disproportionately low. (2) This Act does not prohibit P from taking any action which is a proportionate means of achieving the aim of (a) enabling or encouraging persons who share the protected characteristic to overcome or minimise that disadvantage, (b) meeting those needs, or (c) enabling or encouraging persons who share the protected characteristic to participate in that activity. (4) This section does not apply to (a) action within section 159(3)\\nSection 159 is headed Positive action: recruitment and promotion.\\nIt provides a defence where action is taken on the grounds of a protected characteristic to overcome disadvantages a person with that characteristic may face in obtaining employment or promotion.\\nSection 159(3) provides: That action is treating a person (A) more favourably in connection with recruitment or promotion than another person (B) because A has the protected characteristic but B does not.\\nSection 193 provides: (1) A person does not contravene this Act only by restricting the provision of benefits to persons who share a protected characteristic if the person acts in pursuance of a charitable (a) instrument, and the provision of the benefits is within subsection (b) (2). (2) The provision of benefits is within this subsection if it is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate (a) aim, or (b) for a disadvantage characteristic. for the purpose of preventing or compensating the protected linked\\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has the power to issue codes of guidance.\\nThe court must take any such code into account in any way in which it appears to the court to be relevant: section 15(4)(b) of the Equality Act 2006.\\nSection 3(1) of the HRA states that [s]o far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights.\\nThe Convention rights are those set out in the European Convention on Human Rights (the ECHR), as contained in Schedule 1 to the HRA.\\nThey include article 8 (right to respect for private and family life and the home), article 9 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion) and article 14 (prohibition of discrimination).\\nArticle 14 provides: The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\\nIn this case, AIHA relies on defences under section 158, section 193(2)(a) and section 193(2)(b) of the 2010 Act.\\nSuccess on any of these will mean that the appellants claim fails.\\nFactual background\\nThe Council is a local housing authority with statutory functions in relation to the allocation of social housing.\\nAs well as allocating its own stock of social housing, it also discharges its functions by nominating applicants for social housing to properties owned by independent housing associations such as AIHA.\\nThe Council assesses applications for social housing using a points based system which is based on need.\\nAIHA is a charitable housing association, established in 1986.\\nIn order to qualify as a charity, its activities must be for the public benefit: see section 4 of the Charities Act 2011 (the Charities Act).\\nIt is registered with the Regulator of Social Housing of England as a private registered provider of social housing under Part 2 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008.\\nIt owns property in Hackney, principally in parts of the borough which are inhabited by members of the Orthodox Jewish community.\\nAIHAs charitable objects are set out in its rules, which state: A2 The Association is formed for the benefit of the community.\\nIts object shall be to carry on for the benefit of the community (and   \n",

Text: This case concerns the use in a criminal trial of evidence obtained by members of the public acting as so called paedophile hunter (PH) groups, and whether this is compatible with the accused persons rights under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the ECHR).\\nPH groups impersonate children online to lure persons into making inappropriate or sexualised communications with them over the internet, and then provide the material generated by such contact to the police.\\nArticle 8 provides: 1.\\nEveryone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 2.\\nThere shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\\nAn adult member of a PH group, acting as a decoy, created a fake profile on the Grindr dating application using a photograph of a boy aged about 13 years old as a lure to attract communications from persons with a sexual interest in children.\\nThe appellant entered into communication with the decoy, who stated in the course of exchanges first on Grindr and continued on the WhatsApp messaging platform that he was 13 years old.\\nIn the belief that the decoy was a child, the appellant sent him a picture of his erect penis.\\nThe appellant also sent him messages to arrange a meeting.\\nWhen the appellant arrived for the meeting, he was confronted by members of the decoys PH group who remained with him until the police arrived.\\nCopies of the appellants communications with the decoy were provided to the police.\\nThe respondent, as public prosecutor, charged the appellant with offences related to sexually motivated communications with a child: (i) an offence of attempting to cause an older child (ie a child who has attained the age of 13 years, but has not yet attained the age of 16 years) to look at a sexual image, for the purposes of obtaining sexual gratification (contrary to section 33 of the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009 the 2009 Act); (ii) an offence of attempting to communicate indecently with an older child (contrary to section 34 of the 2009 Act); and (iii) an offence of attempting to meet with a child for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity (contrary to section 1 of the Protection of Children and the Prevention of Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2005 the 2005 Act).\\nI will refer to these together as the charges.\\nIn each case, the charge was put in terms of an attempt to commit the offence, because the appellant believed the decoy was a child whereas he was in fact an adult.\\nAfter indictment on the charges in Glasgow Sheriff Court, the appellant lodged a preliminary minute objecting to the admissibility of the evidence sought to be relied upon by the respondent on the basis that it had been obtained by covert means without authorisation under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Scotland) Act 2000 (RIPSA).\\nThe appellant also lodged a minute objecting to the admissibility of the evidence provided by the PH group on the basis that it was obtained covertly without authorisation or reasonable suspicion of criminality in violation of his rights under article 8.\\nBy a ruling dated 30 July 2018, after a hearing conducted on the basis of agreed facts (as set out below), the Sheriff repelled the appellants objections to the admissibility of the evidence provided by the PH group.\\nLater, at a trial on 29 and 30 August 2018, the respondent led evidence from the decoy and two police officers.\\nThe appellant did not lead any evidence.\\nHe was convicted on each of the charges.\\nAt a later hearing, the appellant was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment on each charge, to be served consecutively.\\nHe was also made subject to the notification requirements of section 92(2) of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 for a period of ten years.\\nThe appellant appealed against his conviction to the High Court of Justiciary (the High Court).\\nHe contended that the Sheriff should have found that the evidence provided by the PH group was obtained in breach of the requirements of RIPSA, that his rights under article 8 in relation to respect for his private life and correspondence were violated by admission of that evidence and that the Sheriff should have excluded it.\\nThe appellants appeal was heard in conjunction with the appeal in another case, which is not relevant for present purposes.\\nBy an interlocutor dated 20 September 2019 the High Court (the Lord Justice General, Lord Brodie and Lord Malcolm) refused both appeals.\\nIt granted the appellant permission to appeal to this court in relation to certain compatibility issues.\\nThe appeal on the compatibility issues\\nArticle 8 is a Convention right for the purposes of the Human Rights Act 1998 (the HRA).\\nSection 6(1) of the HRA provides that [i]t is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right (this is subject to certain exceptions which are not relevant in this case).\\nA prosecuting authority is a public authority.\\nA court also is a public authority for these purposes: section 6(3)(a) of the HRA.\\nThe case comes before this court by way of an appeal on compatibility issues pursuant to section 288AA of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995.\\nSo far as is relevant for present purposes, a compatibility issue means a question, arising in criminal proceedings, as to whether a public authority has acted in a way which is made unlawful by section 6(1) of the HRA: see section 288AA(4), read with section 288ZA(2).\\nOn an appeal under section 288AA, the powers of the Supreme Court are exercisable only for the purpose of determining the compatibility issue (subsection (2)(a)); when it has determined the compatibility issue the Supreme Court must remit the proceedings to the High Court (subsection (3)).\\nAn appeal under section 288AA may be brought only with permission given by the High Court or by the Supreme Court (subsection (5)).\\nIn this case, the High Court has granted permission to appeal in relation to its determination in the criminal proceedings against the appellant of two compatibility issues, as follows: 1. whether, in respect of the type of communications used by the appellant and the PH group, article 8 rights may be interfered with by their use as evidence in a public prosecution of the appellant for a relevant offence; and 2. the extent to which the obligation on the state, to provide adequate protection for article 8 rights, is incompatible with the use by a public prosecutor of material supplied by PH groups in investigating and prosecuting crime.\\nAs should be clear, this is not a full appeal, but an appeal limited to these compatibility issues.\\nFactual background and the judgment of the High Court\\nIn his ruling on 30 July 2018 the Sheriff set out the agreed facts as follows: 2.\\nThe Crown witness, Paul Devine, is a volunteer with Groom Resisters Scotland, an organisation which aims to protect children by catching online predators.\\nThe organisation consists of decoys and hunters.\\nDecoys create fake online personas with a general appearance of being under the age of 16.\\nThey remain in character as someone aged less than 16 in all communications with the public.\\nIn the event of a member of the public having apparently engaged in a sexual conversation with a decoy, a face to face meeting will be arranged at which a hunter or hunters will be present, who will then record and film the member of the public, while confronting them regarding the persons prior communication with the decoy persona.\\nThis recording may also be made available on the internet live, so that interested parties can see the confrontation take place.\\nThe video will also be uploaded onto various websites in order that it may be viewed by others.\\nThe organisation makes contact with the police at or after the time of the confrontation.\\nThe sexual communications between the decoy and the member of the public concerned, as well as the recording/film, of that persons confrontation with the hunters or extracts therefrom, are disclosed to the police for investigation. 3.\\nGroom Resisters Scotland is one of several organisations deploying similar operating methods which operate in Scotland and other parts of the United Kingdom.\\nThe police are aware that there are a number of hunter organisations operating in Scotland and across the United Kingdom, and evidence obtained from those organisations has led to a number of criminal investigations and prosecutions.\\nIn the present case the crown witness Devine, acted as a 4. decoy.\\nGroom Resisters Scotland provided him with photographs of a boy aged approximately 13 years old and he created an online profile on an App named Grindr, a forum through which males apparently can arrange to meet one another, inter alia, for sexual purposes.\\nThe terms and conditions of that App specify that users must be aged 18 or over.\\nThere was communication between the witness Devine, as the decoy and the minuter [the appellant], wherein sexual images and sexual written communications were sent by the minuter to the decoy.\\nThe decoy shared fake personal details with the minuter, staying in character as a 13 year old boy.\\nDuring the course of communications with the minuter, the decoys Grindr account was blocked and could no longer be used.\\nThere was further communication between the decoy and the minuter on WhatsApp and ultimately, arrangements were made between the minuter and the decoy for them to meet in person.\\nThe decoy advised two of the hunters in Groom Resisters Scotland, namely Crown witnesses Carling and Constable of these arrangements.\\nThe Witnesses Carling and Constable then attended the meeting place at the arranged time and confronted the minuter, broadcasting the confrontation live on Facebook.\\nFilm of the confrontation has since been posted onto social media.\\nDuring the confrontation the police were contacted by Groom Resisters Scotland.\\nPolice officers attended during the ongoing confrontation between the minuter and the hunters and Groom Resisters Scotland subsequently provided the police with extracts of the communications between the minuter and the decoy and the minuter and the hunters.\\nThe High Court, in its judgment, referred to exchanges taking place in online chat rooms; but the parties agree that this was a slip.\\nAll the relevant exchanges took place in communications between the appellant and the decoy which were not shared with others.\\nThe exchanges using the WhatsApp messaging platform were protected by end to end encryption.\\nThe evidence led at trial confirmed the account given above.\\nThe appellant initially contacted the decoy on Grindr on 18 January 2018.\\nThe record of the communications between them provided by the PH group showed that from the initial point of contact by the appellant, sexually explicit questions and statements were sent by the appellant to the decoy, as were sexually explicit photographs, including, at the outset, a photograph of the appellant holding his erect penis, to which the decoy responded stating that he was 13.\\nOver the period to 31 January, when the meeting which was arranged by the appellant took place, sexual communications continued to be sent by the appellant to the decoy.\\nDuring that period the decoy remained in character as a 13 year old boy.\\nAll sexual communications came from the appellant.\\nThe decoy responded to the appellants messages, including answering questions posed of him about his sexuality.\\nThe appellant asked the decoy to delete the messages which the decoy agreed to do.\\nAfter some time, the appellant asked the decoy to move the conversation to WhatsApp and they swapped telephone numbers to enable this to happen.\\nEntrapment was not in issue in the case, so no examination of the law in relation to that topic is needed.\\nThe appellant complained that the circumstances of the case were such that authorisation was required to be obtained under RIPSA for the decoy to act as a covert human intelligence source within the meaning of that Act; that no such authorisation had been obtained; and that as a result the evidence of the decoy had been obtained unlawfully.\\nHowever, the Sheriff and the High Court held that RIPSA had no application in the circumstances of this case, since the decoy acted on his own initiative and not at the instigation of the police (paras 52 53 of the High Courts judgment).\\nThis part of the High Courts judgment is not a matter which affects the compatibility issues which this court has to decide.\\nThe Dean of Faculty, Mr Gordon Jackson QC, for the appellant, sought to raise the RIPSA issue at the hearing before us in order to develop an argument that the acquisition and use of the evidence of the communications between the appellant and the decoy were not in accordance with the law, as is required by article 8(2) where there is an interference with rights under article 8(1).\\nHowever, the compatibility issues to which the appeal relates do not turn on the application of article 8(2), but on the prior question of the extent and effect of the rights conferred by article 8(1).\\nThere was also some debate at the hearing in this court as to whether the appellant thought that the decoy was a child at the time he sent his first message to him.\\nThe Dean of Faculty claimed that the appellant only learned this later in the course of their exchanges.\\nHe emphasised that according to Grindrs terms a person can only have a profile on the site if they are 18 or over, and observed that people putting up profiles on dating sites do not always use true photographs of themselves.\\nThe Solicitor General for Scotland, Ms Alison Di Rollo QC, for the respondent, did not accept the Dean of Facultys claim.\\nShe pointed out that the profile photograph used by the decoy appeared to be of a child, that the standard terms of dating websites regarding age are not always observed by persons using those sites, and that the appellant was told by the decoy that he was 13 years old very early in the exchanges and expressed no surprise and was in no way deterred from continuing to send sexualized messages.\\nThis court is not in a position to resolve this issue of fact and it is not necessary to do so for the purposes of this appeal.\\nThe charges in the indictment related to communications across the period from 18 to 31 January 2018, without dividing up the communications more precisely in respect of their timing.\\nThe trial was conducted on that basis, without any need for findings to be made as to the appellants precise state of belief as to the age of the person with whom he was communicating at the outset of that period.\\nThe appellant did not give evidence about that.\\nNor did he make any submissions in the Sheriff Court or the High Court about this point, or suggest that it was a significant matter in relation to what are now the compatibility issues before this court.\\nAccordingly, it is appropriate to proceed on the footing that throughout the whole or substantially the whole of the course of the relevant communications between the appellant and the decoy, the appellant believed the decoy to be a child aged 13.\\nThe High Court noted that the ECHR, and article 8 in particular, is primarily concerned with the protection of the rights of individuals from interference by the state.\\nHowever, the High Court also observed (para 47) that, in addition to its prohibitive aspect, article 8 imposes a positive obligation on the state to provide a suitable framework within which an individuals article 8(1) rights are protected from interference by other private individuals, including employers, citing Kpke v Germany (2011) 53 EHRR SE 26 (p 249), para 41, and the judgment of the Third Section of the ECtHR in Ribalda v Spain CE:ECHR:2018:0109JUD000187413, para 54 (there is now a Grand Chamber judgment in this case, dated 17 October 2019, to which I refer below).\\nThe High Court held (para 48) that since the decoy acted on his own behalf as a private citizen and not at the instigation of the police or any other public authority, the gathering of the evidence of the communications by him was not a case of interference by the state with the appellants correspondence.\\nThe appellant had sent his messages to the decoy, who had received them and passed them on to the police: There was no surveillance or interception (AD v The Netherlands, European Commission on Human Rights [CE:ECHR:1994:0111DEC002196293] THE LAW at para 2 citing G, S and M v Austria (App no 9614/81), unreported, European Commission on Human Rights, 12 October 1983). [The appellant was] fully participating in the communications and [was] aware that they were reaching the intended recipient [].\\nThe messages had reached their destination and in due course they were handed to the police for the purposes of prosecuting a crime.\\nAs regards the appellants private life, the High Court was prepared to accept (para 49) that, at a general level, a persons internet chats fall within the broad ambit of article 8(1) (Garamukanwa v United Kingdom [2019] IRLR 853, ECtHR, para 22), but went on to say that given the lack of any longstanding pre existing relationship between the appellant and the person with whom he thought he was communicating, he had no reasonable expectation that the communications would remain confidential or private (Halford v United Kingdom (1997) 24 EHRR 523, para 45; Ribalda v Spain, judgment of the Third Section, para 57; Garamukanwa v United Kingdom, para 23).\\nThe appellant had voluntarily engaged in his communications on Grindr and WhatsApp with a person he believed to be a child, for sexual purposes.\\nBy the time the police were informed, the criminal activity had already been carried out.\\nThe court said (para 50) that even if there had been a reasonable expectation of privacy or confidentiality on the part of the appellant, the interference with the appellants right to respect for his private life would have been justified under article 8(2).\\nThere was no involvement of the state prior to the evidence of the communications being obtained; the evidence was delivered to the police for the purposes of prosecuting significant criminal activities; and the admission of the evidence of the communications to proof at trial would be subject to the common law rules of fairness.\\nThe activities of the decoy were subject to general legal constraints applicable to him as a private individual at common law and under the criminal law, and his actions were justifiable as being for legitimate purposes of the prevention of crime and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\\nThe court further observed (para 51) that even if there had been a violation of the appellants article 8 right to private life, it would not necessarily follow that the evidence of the communications provided by the decoy should have been excluded from admission to proof at trial.\\nThe question of exclusion or not of evidence gathered in breach of a persons rights under article 8 would depend upon whether it was possible to have a fair trial, on application of article 6 of the ECHR (right to a fair trial) and domestic law rules to safeguard the fairness of criminal proceedings.\\nIn the courts view, given the protections available under both these regimes, there was no unfairness in the criminal proceedings against the appellant arising from the admission of the evidence provided by the decoy.\\nDiscussion Issue (1): were article 8 rights interfered with by the use of the communications provided by the PH group as evidence in the public prosecution of the appellant?\\nThis issue is directed to consideration of the rights of the appellant under article 8(1) which are said to be relevant in the conte   \n",
                            "7820                        Summarize this legal case and explain any terms. Text: Where an international commercial contract contains an agreement to resolve disputes by arbitration, at least three systems of national law are engaged when a dispute occurs.\\nThey are: the law governing the substance of the dispute; the law governing the agreement to arbitrate; and the law governing the arbitration process.\\nThe law governing the substance of the dispute is generally the law applicable to the contract from which the dispute has arisen.\\nThe law governing the arbitration process (sometimes referred to as the curial law) is generally the law of the seat of the arbitration, which is usually the place chosen for the arbitration in the arbitration agreement.\\nThese two systems of law may differ from each other.\\nEach may also differ from the law which governs the validity and scope of the arbitration agreement.\\nThe central issue on this appeal concerns which system of national law governs the validity and scope of the arbitration agreement when the law applicable to the contract containing it differs from the law of the seat of the arbitration.\\nThis is an issue which has long divided courts and commentators, both in this country and internationally.\\nOn one side there are those who say that the law that governs a contract should generally also govern an arbitration agreement which, though separable, forms part of that contract.\\nOn the other side there are those who say that the law of the chosen seat of the arbitration should also generally govern the arbitration agreement.\\nThere have been Court of Appeal decisions falling on either side of this divide: Sulamrica Cia Nacional de Seguros SA v Enesa Engenharia SA [2012] EWCA Civ 638; [2013] 1 WLR 102 and C v D [2007] EWCA Civ 1282; [2008] Bus LR 843.\\nIn its judgment in the present case [2020] EWCA Civ 574, the Court of Appeal considered that the time has come to seek to impose some order and clarity on this area of the law (para 89) and held that, unless there has been an express choice of the law that is to govern the arbitration agreement, the general rule should be that the arbitration agreement is governed by the law of the seat, as a matter of implied choice, subject only to any particular features of the case demonstrating powerful reasons to the contrary (para 91).\\nOn this appeal the appellant argues that this conclusion is heterodox and wrong and that the correct approach is that, in the absence of strong indications to the contrary, a choice of law for the contract is a choice of that law to govern the arbitration agreement.\\nThe appellant contends that in the present case the parties have chosen Russian law to govern the construction contract between them and that the implication that they intended the arbitration agreement included in that contract to be governed by Russian law is not displaced by their choice of London as the seat of arbitration.\\nIf that issue is decided in its favour, the appellant goes on to argue that the Court of Appeal was wrong to grant an injunction to restrain it from pursuing proceedings in Russia in alleged breach of the arbitration agreement.\\nThe appellants case is that, because the arbitration agreement is governed by Russian law, the Russian courts are best placed to decide whether or not the arbitration agreement applies to the claim which the appellant has brought against the respondent in Russia and that, as a matter of comity or discretion, the English courts ought not to interfere with those proceedings by granting an anti suit injunction. II.\\nFactual background\\n(i) The construction contract\\nOn 1 February 2016 a power plant situated at Berezovskaya in Russia was severely damaged by fire.\\nThe appellant (Chubb Russia) is a Russian insurance company which had insured the owner of the power plant, a company now named PJSC Unipro (Unipro), against such damage.\\nChubb Russia is part of the Chubb Group, which is the worlds largest publicly traded property and casualty insurer.\\nThe company responsible for the design and construction of the power plant under a contract made with Unipro in May 2011 was a Russian company called CJSC Energoproekt.\\nThe respondent (Enka) was engaged by Energoproekt as one of many sub contractors involved in the construction project.\\nEnka is a global engineering and construction company incorporated and based in Turkey with a substantial presence and history of operations in Russia, amongst other countries.\\nThe contract between Energoproekt and Enka dated 27 June 2012 (the construction contract) is a substantial document running to 97 pages, with around 400 pages of attachments.\\nIt was executed in parallel Russian and English versions (though it provides that the Russian language version has precedence).\\nThe construction contract contains, in article 50, a dispute resolution clause in these terms: Resolution of disputes 50.1.\\nThe Parties undertake to make in good faith every reasonable effort to resolve any dispute or disagreement arising from or in connection with this Agreement (including disputes regarding validity of this agreement and the fact of its conclusion (hereinafter Dispute) by means of negotiations between themselves.\\nIn the event of the failure to resolve any Dispute pursuant to this article within 10 (ten) days from the date that either Party sends a Notification to the opposite Party containing an indication of the given Dispute (the given period may be extended by mutual consent of the Parties) any Party may, by giving written notice, cause the matter to be referred to a meeting between the senior managements of the Contractor and Customer (in the case of the Contractor senior management shall be understood as a member of the executive board or above, in the case of Customer, senior management shall be understood as general directors of their respective companies).\\nThe parties may invite the End Customer to such Senior Management Meeting.\\nSuch meeting shall be held within fourteen (14) calendar days following the giving of a notice.\\nIf the matter is not resolved within twenty (20) calendar days after the date of the notice referring the matter to appropriate higher management or such later date as may be unanimously agreed upon, the Dispute shall be referred to international arbitration as follows: the Dispute shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce, appointed in accordance with these Rules, language, and the Dispute shall be settled by three arbitrators the arbitration shall be conducted in the English the place of arbitration shall be London, England. in 50.2.\\nUnless otherwise explicitly stipulated this Agreement, the existence of any Dispute shall not give the Contractor the right to suspend Work. 50.3.\\nNot used. 50.4.\\nNot used. 50.5.\\nAll other documentation such as financial documentation and cover documents for it must be presented in Russian.\\nOn 21 May 2014 Energoproekt transferred its rights and obligations under the construction contract to Unipro pursuant to an assignment agreement made between Energoproekt, Unipro and Enka.\\nBy clause 7.5 of that agreement, the parties agreed that disputes between Unipro and Enka were to be finally and exclusively resolved by arbitration in accordance with the provisions of article 50.1 of the construction contract.\\nAfter the fire in February 2016 Chubb Russia paid 26.1 billion roubles (approximately US$400m) to Unipro under its property insurance policy and thereby became subrogated to any rights of Unipro to claim compensation from third parties for the damage caused by the fire.\\n(ii) The Russian proceedings\\nOn 25 May 2019 Chubb Russia filed a claim in the Moscow Arbitrazh (ie commercial) Court against Enka and ten other defendants whom it claimed were jointly liable for the damage caused by the fire.\\nChubb Russia was required by the Moscow court to provide further details of its claims, following which the claims were accepted by the court on 3 September 2019.\\nOn 17 September 2019 Enka filed a motion in the Russian proceedings to have Chubb Russias claim against it dismissed (or left without consideration) pursuant to article 148(5) of the Arbitrazh Procedure Code, which is intended to give effect to Russias obligations under article II(3) of the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards 1958 (the New York Convention) to refer to arbitration parties who have agreed to submit to arbitration a dispute of which a court of a contracting state is seized.\\nEnka argued that the claim against it fell within the scope of the arbitration agreement contained in article 50.1 of the construction contract and ought therefore to be resolved, not by the Russian courts, but by an arbitration conducted in accordance with that provision in London.\\nThe Moscow court decided to deal with Enkas motion at the same time as the merits of Chubb Russias claims at a hearing fixed for 22 January 2020.\\nFollowing that hearing, which continued on two later dates, on 18 March 2020 the judge in the Russian proceedings announced her decisions (a) not to grant Enkas motion to refer the claim against it to arbitration and (b) to dismiss Chubb Russias claims against all the defendants on the merits.\\nThe reasons for those decisions were given in a written judgment handed down on 6 May 2020.\\nChubb Russia and Enka have both filed appeals in the Russian proceedings (in relation to the decision on the merits and the decision to refuse Enkas application, respectively).\\n(iii) The English proceedings\\nMeanwhile, Enka had on 16 September 2019 brought an arbitration claim in the Commercial Court in London seeking an anti suit injunction to restrain Chubb Russia from further pursuing the Russian proceedings against Enka on the ground that this was a breach of the arbitration agreement in article 50.1 of the construction contract.\\nEnka also sought injunctions against other members of the Chubb Group said to be caught up in Chubb Russias breach of the arbitration agreement, namely Chubb UK Ltd, Chubb European Group SE (Chubb Europe) and the ultimate parent company of the Chubb Group which is incorporated in Switzerland.\\nOn 15 October 2019 Carr J declined to grant an interim anti suit injunction but gave directions for an expedited trial.\\nThe trial took place on 11 and 12 December 2019 before Andrew Baker J. He gave judgment on 20 December 2019, dismissing Enkas claims against all the defendants.\\nHis primary reason for doing so was that he considered the appropriate forum to decide whether Chubb Russias claim against Enka falls within the arbitration agreement to be the Moscow Arbitrazh Court and not the English Commercial Court.\\nEnka applied to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal from this decision as it applied to Chubb Russia (alone).\\nThe application was granted on 6 February 2020 and the appeal was heard on 7 and 8 April 2020.\\nOn 29 April 2020 the Court of Appeal (Flaux, Males and Popplewell LJJ) allowed Enkas appeal and issued an anti suit injunction restraining Chubb Russia from continuing the Russian proceedings.\\n(iv) The arbitration proceedings\\nOn 10 January 2020 Enka gave notice to Chubb Russia and Chubb Europe of a Dispute under article 50 of the construction contract.\\nThis was followed on 11 March 2020 by a request for arbitration filed with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in which Enka sought a declaration that Chubb Russias claims in the Russian court fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement and damages.\\nOn 22 May 2020 Chubb Russia and Chubb Europe filed their answer to the request for arbitration in which they challenged the jurisdiction of the arbitrators and denied that Enka is entitled to any of the relief claimed.\\nOn 12 June 2020 the ICC notified the parties of the appointment of Mr Michael Brindle QC as president of the arbitral tribunal.\\nThe other members of the tribunal are Lord Hoffmann, nominated by Enka, and Lord Mance, nominated by Chubb Russia and Chubb Europe (without prejudice to their objections to the jurisdiction of the tribunal).\\n(v) This appeal\\nOn 26 May 2020 Chubb Russia applied to the Supreme Court for permission to appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeal.\\nOn 5 June 2020 this court granted permission to appeal and also stayed the anti suit injunction upon Chubb Russia giving suitable undertakings to protect Enkas position pending the outcome of the appeal.\\nThe appeal was expedited and heard over two days on 27 and 28 July 2020.\\nIt is a striking feature of the English proceedings that the trial, the appeal to the Court of Appeal and the appeal to the Supreme Court have all been heard in just over seven months.\\nThis is a vivid demonstration of the speed with which the English courts can act when the urgency of a matter requires it. III.\\nThe English conflict of laws rules\\n(i) The Rome I Regulation\\nWhere a court of England and Wales has to decide which system of national law governs a contract, the court must normally apply the provisions of the Rome I Regulation (a shorthand for Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations).\\nBy article 1(1), the Rome I Regulation applies, in situations involving a conflict of laws, to contractual obligations in civil and commercial matters.\\nArticle 1(2)(e), however, excludes from its scope arbitration agreements and agreements on the choice of court.\\nPursuant to article 3, a contract to which the Rome I Regulation applies is governed by the law chosen by the parties, where the choice is made expressly or clearly demonstrated by the terms of the contract or the circumstances of the case.\\nIn determining whether the parties have made a choice of law, the court should adopt a broad Regulation based approach, not constrained by national rules of contractual interpretation: see eg Dicey, Morris & Collins on The Conflict of Laws, 15th ed (2012), para 32 048.\\nArticle 4 contains rules for determining the law applicable to the contract to the extent that no such choice has been made.\\nArticle 4(1) sets out presumptions or prima facie rules that apply in relation to particular types of contract.\\nHowever, where it is clear from the circumstances of the case that the contract is manifestly more closely connected with another country, or where none of the prima facie rules applies, articles 4(3) and 4(4) respectively provide for the contract to be governed by the law of the country with which it is most closely connected.\\n(ii) The common law rules\\nBecause the Rome I Regulation does not apply to arbitration agreements, an English court which has to decide which system of law governs the validity, scope or interpretation of an arbitration agreement must apply the rules developed by the common law for determining the law governing contractual obligations.\\nThose rules are that a contract (or relevant part of it) is governed by: (i) the law expressly or impliedly chosen by the parties; or (ii) in the absence of such choice, the law with which it is most closely connected: see eg Dicey, Morris & Collins on The Conflict of Laws, 15th ed (2012), rule 64(1).\\nIn view of the similarity between the common law rules and the rules provided by the Rome I Regulation, cases in which the two regimes would yield different results are likely to be rare.\\nBut in principle, where an English court has to determine which law governs an arbitration agreement incorporated in a contract, it is the common law rules alone which because of the exclusion of arbitration agreements from the scope of the Rome I Regulation by article 1(2)(e) the court must apply.\\n(iii) Party choice\\nThe starting point at common law (as under the Rome I Regulation) is that contracting parties are free to choose the system of law which is to govern their contract, provided only that their choice is not contrary to public policy.\\nThe court must therefore construe the contract to see whether the parties have agreed on a choice of law to govern it.\\nAs Lord Diplock explained in Cie Tunisienne de Navigation SA v Cie dArmement Maritime SA [1971] AC 572, 603: The first stage, therefore, when any question arises between parties to a contract as to the proper law applicable to it, is to determine whether the parties intended by their contract to exercise any choice at all and, if they did, to determine what was the system of law which they selected.\\nIn determining this the English court applies the ordinary rules of English law relating to the construction of contracts.\\nThe exclusion of arbitration agreements from the scope of the Rome I Regulation by article 1(2)(e) does not prevent an arbitration clause from being taken into consideration for the purposes of article 3 in determining whether there has been a choice of the law applicable to other parts of the contract, as noted in Giuliano and Lagarde, Council Report on the Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations (OJ EU No C 282 1) at p 12.\\nBy the same token, the fact that other parts of the contract are within the scope of the Rome I Regulation does not prevent them from being taken into consideration in determining in accordance with the English common law rules of construction whether the parties have agreed on a choice of law to govern the arbitration clause.\\nLike any question of contractual interpretation, this is a unitary exercise which requires the court to construe the contract, including the arbitration clause, as a whole.\\n(iv) Law of the forum\\nWhere an English court has to decide whether a contract which is said to be governed by a foreign system of law is valid, the court applies the putative applicable law, in other words the law which would govern the contract if it were validly concluded.\\nAt the prior stage, however, of determining what is the applicable law or putative applicable law of the contract, all the leading authorities proceed on the basis that it is English rules of law which apply, as stated by Lord Diplock in the passage quoted above.\\nIn the Tunisienne case, for example, a contract for the transport of oil in several shipments contained a provision (clause 13) that the contract shall be governed by the laws of the flag of the vessels carrying the goods .\\nThe first question which the House of Lords had to decide was whether, in the circumstances of the case which included the fact that vessels flying different flags were used to ship the oil, this clause conveyed a choice of French law to govern the contract, as the shipowners argued.\\nTo answer that question the House did not apply the rules of French law governing the interpretation of contracts, but (only) those of English law.\\nThe same approach was adopted in Whitworth Street Estates (Manchester) Ltd v James Miller & Partners Ltd [1970] AC 583, where the House of Lords held that subsequent conduct of the parties could not be looked at to construe a contract in order to decide whether it was intended to be governed by English (rather than Scottish) law.\\nThe exclusion of subsequent conduct as an aid to interpretation is a consequence of the objective principle of interpretation in English law, which searches not for what the parties subjectively thought or intended the effect of their contract to be but for what reasonable people in their position would be understood to have meant by the language used.\\nAlthough in the Whitworth Street Estates case English law was one putative applicable law of the contract, there is no suggestion in the speeches that this was the basis for applying English principles of contractual interpretation.\\nIn our view, it is both consistent with authority and sound in principle to apply English law as the law of the forum to ascertain whether the parties have agreed on the law which is to govern their contract (and, if not, what law governs it in the absence of agreement).\\nTo apply any other law for this purpose would introduce an additional layer of complexity into the conflict of laws analysis without any clea

Summary:\\nThe appellants and the respondents were owners of adjoining collieries and the suit out of which the present appeal arose was one brought by the respondents for certain reliefs on the allegation that the appellants had encroached upon their coal mines and removed coal from the encroached portion and that they came to know of the said encroachment and removal of coal after they had received the letter dated August 18, 1941, from the Inspector of Mines.\\nThe appellant denied the encroachment and pleaded that the suit was barred by limitation inasmuch as the respondents had knowledge of the encroachment in 1932 then there was a survey by the Department of Mines.\\nThe trial judge found on evidence that the proceedings in 1932 had nothing to do with the matter, held that article 48 of the Limitation Act applied to the suit and that the appellants had failed to prove that the respondents had knowledge of the sinking of the quarries and pits in the encroached land and decreed the suit.\\nThe High Court on appeal accepted the finding of the trial court and although it placed the burden of proving knowledge on the part of the respondents beyond the prescribed time on the appellants, nevertheless proceeded on the assumption that the initial burden to prove that they had knowledge of the said encroachment within the period was on the respondents and affirmed the decree of the trial court.\\nHeld, that the burden of proof had not been misplaced.\\nUnder article 48 of the Indian Limitation Act, which prescribes a three years ' limitation from the date of the knowledge, the initial onus is obviously on the plaintiff to prove that date since it would be within his special knowledge.\\nMoreover, under section 3 of the Act, which makes its obligatory on the court to dismiss a suit barred by limitation, even though such a plea is not set up in defence, it is for the plaintiff to establish that the suit is not so barred.\\nLalchand Marwari vs Mahant Rampur Gir, pat.\\n(P.C.) 312 and Rajah Sahib Perhalad Seim vs Maharajah Rajender Kishore Singh, (1869) 12 M.I.A. 292, referred to.\\nUnder the there is an essential distinc tion between burden of proof as a matter of law and pleading and as a matter of adducing evidence and under section 101 of the 493 Act the burden in the former sense is always on the plaintiff and never shifts, but the burden in the latter sense may according to the evidence led by the parties and presumptions of law or fact raised in their favour.\\nSundarji Shivji vs Secretary of State for India, Pat. 752,

Ltd., A.I.R. 1946 Cal.\\n123, Bank of Bombay vs Fazulbhoy Ebrahim, and Talyarkhan vs Gangadas, Bom.\\n848,approved.\\nHeld, further, that it is well settled that a map referred to in a lease is a part of the lease.\\nWhere, therefore, the map is drawn to scale and clearly demarcates the boundary it is not permissible to ignore it and reconstruct the boundary with reference to the revenue records.\\nDarapali Sadagar vs jajir Ahmad, Cal. 394, referred to.\\n\\nExplanation:\\n- successors: a person who has succeeded in a legal proceeding\\n- costs: cost\\n- records: records   \n",

                            Summary:\\nThe respondents firm claimed exemption from Sales Tax under article 286(i)(b) of the Constitution in respect of sales 925 made by them of cotton and castor oil on the ground that the sales were on F.O.B. contracts under which they continued to be the owners of the goods till those crossed the custom barrier and entered the export stream.\\nThey also contested the purchase tax to which they were assessed under section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act.\\nThe High Court upheld the contention of the respondents regarding the Sales Tax but held that they were liable to pay purchase tax.\\nOn appeal by both the parties Held, that the goods remained the seller 's property till those had been brought and loaded on board the ship and so the sales were exempted from tax under article 286(i) of the Constitution.\\nThe word \" a person \" in section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act had been correctly interpreted as \" a registered dealer \" and the purchasing dealers had been rightly assessed to purchase tax.\\nThe normal rule in F. 0.\\nB. contracts was that the property was intended to pass and did pass on the shipment of the goods.\\nThe presumption in F. 0.\\nB. contracts was that it was the duty of the buyer to obtain the necessary export licence, though in the circumstances of a particular case that duty might fall on the seller.\\nH.O.

Pound & Co., Ltd., (1953) 1.Q.B. 499, considered.\\n\"Export \" under the Import and Export Control Act having been defined as \" taking out of India by land, sea or air \" it could not, under the Export Control Order, be held to have commenced till the ship carrying the goods left the port or in some cases passed the territorial waters.\\nThe State of Bombay vs The United Motors (India) Ltd., (1953) 4 S.T.C. 133, held inapplicable.\\n\\nExplanation:\\n- general: general\\n- powers: power\\n- costs: cost   \n",

murder.\\nThe facts established were that there were quarrels between the appellant and the deceased over the purchase of a cycle and in a play of cards that the appellant had purchased a sword a day earlier and that he had deposited the sword stained with human blood at the police station shortly after the murder.\\nEvidence was also led of an extra judicial confession made by the appellant to one U but the High Court did not place reliance on it as it did not feel sure of it though it observed that a perusal of the statement of U showed that it was very likely that what he stated may have happened.\\n^ Held, that the statement of U regarding the extra judicial confession was erroneously rejected by the High Court.\\nExtra judicial confessions were not usually considered with favour but such a confession coming from a person who had no reason to state falsely and to whom it was made in circumstances which tended to support his statement could be relied upon.\\nThe extra judicial confession in the present case was supported by the facts established, and these together fully established the guilt of the appellant.\\n\\nExplanation:\\n- No specific legal terms found.   \n",

                                           Summary:\\nS, employed by the appellant as a cross cutter in the saw mill was asked to show cause why his services should not be terminated on account of grave indiscipline and misconduct and he denied the allegations of fact.\\nHe was thereafter informed about a department enquiry to be held against him and was suspended pending enquiry.\\nPurporting to act under r. 18(a) of the Standing Orders, the appellant terminated the services of S, without holding any departmental enquiry.\\nThe industrial tribunal to which the dispute was referred held, that action taken, after dropping the proposed departmental proceedings was not bonafide and was a colourable exercise of the powerconferred under r. 18(a) of the Standing order and since no attempt was made before it to defend such action by proving the alleged misconduct, it passed an order for reinstatement of S, The appellant contended that as the termination was strictly in accordance with the terms of contract under r. 18(a) of the Standing Orders, it was entitled to dispense 823 with the service of an employee at any time by first giving 14 days notice or, paying 12 days wages.\\n^ Held, that the employer 's decision to discharge the employee under r. 18(a) of the Standing Orders after dropping the enquiry intended to be held for misconduct was clearly a colourable exercise of the power, and an employer could not press his right purely on contract and say that under the contract he has unfettered right \"to hire and fire\" his employees, right was subject to industrial adjudication and even a power like that granted by r. 18(a) of the Standing orders in this case was subject to the scrutiny of industrial courts.\\nEven in a case of this kind the requirement of bona fides was essential and if the termination of service was a colourable exercise of power, or was a result of victimisation or unfair labour practice, the tribunal had jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination.\\nBuckingham and Carnatic Co.

                            "7816  Summary:\\nIn this appeal, the Supreme Court is asked to decide whether findings of fact made by the General Court of the European Union (the General Court) are binding in subsequent domestic proceedings, under the EU principle of absolute res judicata.\\nThe appellants (collectively known as Servier), developed and manufactured the drug Perindopril, which is used to treat cardiovascular diseases including high blood pressure.\\nPerindopril falls within the class of medicines known as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors).\\nThe respondents, who are the claimants in the domestic proceedings, are the national health authorities of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\\nBetween May 2011 and September 2012, the claimants issued proceedings in England and Wales which alleged that Servier had: (i) breached article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and/or Chapter 1 of the Competition Act 1998 (the 1998 Act) by entering into anticompetitive agreements with potential generic manufacturers and/or suppliers; and (ii) abused its dominant position in the market contrary to article 102 TFEU and/or Chapter 2 of the 1998 Act.\\nThe claimants contend that this allegedly unlawful conduct has delayed the entry of cheaper generic versions of Perindopril onto the UK market, which has, in turn, caused the claimants to suffer substantial financial loss.\\nServiers conduct relating to Perindopril was investigated by the European Commission (the Commission).\\nOn 9 July 2014, the Commission issued a decision which found that Servier had infringed articles 101 and 102 TFEU.\\nServier appealed to the General Court seeking the annulment of the Commissions decision.\\nThe General Court judgment upheld all but one of the Commissions findings of infringement of article 101 TFEU, but found that Servier had not infringed article 102 TFEU.\\nThis was because the relevant product market was not limited to Perindopril but extended to ACE inhibitors generally, and Servier did not have a dominant position in that wider market.\\nBoth the Commission and Servier have appealed to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).\\nAs there are significant overlaps, the domestic proceedings cannot proceed to a final trial until the EU proceedings have been resolved.\\nHowever, in October 2016, Servier was granted permission to plead that the claimants failed to take reasonable steps to encourage switching from the prescription of Perindopril to cheaper generic ACE inhibitors.\\nServier asserts that, even if liability and causation are established, the claimants damages should be reduced or extinguished: (i) because the claimants failed to mitigate their loss; (ii) for contributory negligence; and (iii) because the losses claimed are too remote.\\nIt was determined that there should be a trial of preliminary issues relating to this argument.\\nServier argued that certain findings in the General Court judgment in particular concerning the extent to which Perindopril can be substituted for other ACE inhibitors are binding on the domestic courts in the preliminary issues trial.\\nHowever, both the High Court and the Court of Appeal held that none of the findings relied on by Servier constituted res judicata for these purposes.\\nServier appealed to the Supreme Court.\\nIt claimed that the point of law is uncertain, not acte clair, and that the Supreme Court should therefore refer the question to the CJEU under article 267 TFEU.\\nThe Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Serviers appeal.\\nIt holds that the General Court findings Servier relies on are not binding in the domestic proceedings, and declines to make a reference to the CJEU.\\nLord Lloyd Jones gives the judgment, with which all members of the Court agree.\\nThe EU principle of absolute res judicata only applies to judicial decisions which have become definitive, either after all rights of appeal have been exhausted or after the time limits for exercising those appeal rights have expired.\\nThe General Courts findings are not yet definitive, and may never become definitive, because they may be reversed or rendered redundant in the appeal pending before the CJEU.\\nThe findings are not, therefore, binding in the domestic proceedings under the EU principle of absolute res judicata.\\nA reference to the CJEU is unnecessary to decide the issues in this case [31 32].\\nThe Court nevertheless sets out its views on the underlying issues of law, in the hope that they might assist at later stages of the domestic proceedings [32].\\nThe leading authority on the EU principle of absolute res judicata is P&O European Ferries (Vizcaya) SA and Diputacin Foral de Vizcaya v Commission (Joined Cases C 442/03P and C 471/03P) [2006] ECR I 4845 [33 37].\\nThis explains that, where the EU courts have annulled a Commission decision on substantive as opposed to procedural grounds, the substance of that judgment becomes binding on all the world, not just on the parties.\\nThis ensures stability of legal relations, because it means that a matter which has been definitely settled by judicial decision cannot be referred to the courts by different parties for reconsideration [38].\\nThe purpose of the EU principle of absolute res judicata is to prevent the annulling judgment from being called into question in subsequent proceedings.\\nThis purpose provides the key to the principles scope and applicability [38, 42].\\nAbsolute res judicata gives dispositive effect to the judgment itself.\\nIt therefore extends to the essential reasons for the judgment (or ratio decidendi), not just to the outcome set out in the operative part [39 40].\\nOnly those aspects of the judgment which explain why the Commission decision has been annulled form part of the ratio decidendi, because those are the aspects which must be respected to prevent the annulling judgment from being called into question later on [42].\\nThe General Court judgment annuls the Commissions finding that Servier had infringed article 102 TFEU, on the basis that the Commission was wrong to conclude that the relevant product market was limited to Perindopril, as opposed to all ACE inhibitors.\\nThe General Court made a number of findings of fact in this regard, including those Servier relies on.\\nAccordingly, if the General Court judgment becomes definitive and it can be shown that the relevant findings were an essential basis of that judgment, it would not be possible to challenge those findings in later proceedings which sought to contradict the General Courts conclusions on the relevant product market within article 102 TFEU [46].\\nIt is not necessary to treat the General Courts findings as binding in any other legal context.\\nIf the CJEU upholds the General Court judgment that Servier did not infringe article 102 TFEU, the claimants will no longer pursue their article 102 claim.\\nIn any case, at present, the domestic proceedings do not concern the relevant product market for the purposes of that article.\\nInstead, Servier relies on the General Courts findings to support its defence based on mitigation of loss flowing from alleged anti competitive agreements contrary to article 101 TFEU.\\nThe General Courts findings cannot be detached from the authority of the annulling judgment and deployed in this wholly different context [48].\\nServier contends that the General Courts findings are binding in any EU law proceedings which raise the same factual issues [47].\\nThe Supreme Court rejects this argument because it is not supported by the EU or domestic case law [49 60].\\nThis is not surprising, because it would be inconsistent with the purpose of the principle of absolute res judicata [49].\\nServiers proposed approach also raises practical difficulties because it has no workable defined limits.\\nMore generally, if it is confined to the context of the consequences of an annulling judgment, the principle of absolute res judicata promotes legal certainty, the effective judicial control of EU institutions and the maintenance of the EU legal order.\\nHowever, once freed from this restriction, it could operate in way that is arbitrary and unjust, binding persons not party to the original dispute in a wholly different legal context in a way which would be inconsistent with the principles of a fair trial [61].\\nThe claimants claims in the domestic proceedings do not call into question or undermine the General Court judgment or its consequences in any way, nor do they contradict the General Courts decision as to what needs to be done to comply with EU law.\\nThe Supreme Court is therefore satisfied to the standard of acte clair that the EU principle of absolute res judicata does not apply [62].\\n\\nExplanation:\\n- amendments: amendments\\n- general: general\\n-

had dishonestly obtained unlawful and fraudulent profit from sales at The Jazz Caf (this meaning is referred to as M4); and had diverted to himself funds needed for the care of Kolbe Houses residents by securing for himself a contract for unnecessary renovations.\\nThe claimant represented himself at the hearing before the judge.\\nThe judge found that all the articles meanings other than the five relating to Kolbe House were substantially true or, in one instance, had caused no serious harm to the claimants reputation.\\nBut he found that in relation to all 13 meanings the defendants had established a defence to the claim under section 4 of the Act: for, in his opinion, each of them was on a matter of public interest, and it was reasonable for the defendants to have believed that publishing them was in the public interest.\\nSo the judge dismissed the claim.\\nThe Court of Appeal allowed the claimants appeal.\\nIt held that the judge had been wrong to uphold the defence under section 4; that he had not been entitled to find that M4, which it described as the most serious of the allegations, was substantially true; and that the claimant was entitled to damages in respect of M4 and the meanings relating to Kolbe House.\\nLastly, after reviewing transcripts of the hearing, it held that the nature, tenor and frequency of the judges interventions were such as to render [the trial] unfair.\\nIt ordered that the quantification of damages be remitted to a judge other than Mr Justice Jay but did not order a full retrial.\\nThe defendants now appeal to the Supreme Court.\\nThe Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.\\nBut, in place of the Court of Appeals order that only the assessment of damages be remitted, the Court orders that the case be remitted for a full retrial.\\nLord Wilson gives the only judgment, with which the other Justices agree.\\nUnfair trial The Court of Appeal was correct to treat the claimants allegation as being that the trial had been unfair, not that the judge had given the appearance of bias against him.\\nFor it is far from clear that an informed and fair minded observer would consider that the judge had given that appearance [39].\\nThe authorities on an inquiry into the unfairness of a trial establish the following principles: a judges interventions should be as infrequent as possible during cross examination of witnesses, and he must remain above the fray and neutral while evidence is being elicited; the quality of the written judgment cannot render a trial fair in circumstances where the judges interventions at the hearing prejudiced the exploration of evidence; and where a transcript exists, it is not the present practice of higher courts to invite the judge to comment on the allegations, but the fact that he is unable to comment requires those courts to analyse the evidence with great care [40 45].\\nUnrepresented litigants are unlikely to be equipped to withstand judicial pressure and so the judge must temper his conduct accordingly [46].\\nThe factual analysis of the conduct of the trial is set out in the schedule to Lord Wilsons judgment [47].\\nIt is important to remember (among other things) that the excerpts from the transcript which are reproduced there were separated by long stretches of evidence in respect of which no criticism of the judge can be made.\\nBut the transcripts do nevertheless show that the judge directed a barrage of hostility towards the claimants case and towards the claimant himself acting in person.\\nIn doing so the judge used immoderate, ill tempered and at times offensive language.\\nThe Court is driven to uphold the Court of Appeals conclusion that the judge did not allow the claim to be properly presented; that therefore he could not fairly appraise it; and that the trial was unfair.\\nInstead of making allowance for the claimants being unrepresented, the judge harassed and intimidated him [48].\\nThe logical consequence of a conclusion that a trial was unfair is an order for a complete retrial.\\nSo it is hard to understand the Court of Appeals order that all the issues relating to the determination of whether the defendants were liable to the claimant had been concluded.\\nConscious that the justice system has failed both sides, the Court, with deep regret, must order a full retrial [49].\\nPublic interest defence The House of Lords decision in Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd [2001] 2 AC 127 established the existence at common law of a specific defence to a claim for defamation brought in relation to publication of a statement on a matter of public interest.\\nWhere the defamatory material concerned such a matter, the defendant had to show that it had met the standard of responsible journalism, measured by reference to a list of ten factors [53 56].\\nSection 4 of the Act replaced the Reynolds defence with a new defence which, on any view, draws on the principles in Reynolds and later cases [58, 68 69].\\nThe section 4 defence is available where the defendant reasonably believed that publishing the statement complained of was in the public interest (s.4(1)(b)) [52, 62].\\nIn assessing reasonableness, the Court must (among other things) have regard to all the circumstances of the case (s.4(2)) [52, 65]. factors was deliberately omitted from the section [62, 69].\\nThe Court of Appeal was wrong to state that the Reynolds defence and the section 4 defence are not materially different: for the elements of the two cannot be equated [68, 72].\\nIt was also inappropriate for the Court of Appeal to regard the Reynolds factors as a check list in the context of section 4 [69, 77].\\nFor these and other reasons, the new judge should determine whether the public interest defence is available to the defendants without reference to the Court of Appeals reasoning on section 4 [78].\\n\\nExplanation:\\n- amendments: amendments\\n- general: general\\n- authority: authority\\n- records: records   \n",

                    Summary:\\nThis appeal is about the application of anti discrimination law to charities, where they are established to provide benefits (in this case, social housing) for particular groups which are the subject of their charitable objectives.\\nThe relevant anti discrimination laws are contained in the Equality Act 2010 and Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 (the Race Directive).\\nThe charitable objective of Agudas Israel Housing Association Ltd (the Housing Charity) is to make social housing available primarily for members of the Orthodox Jewish community in Hackney, in particular the Haredi community.\\nIt makes properties available via an online portal operated by Hackney London Borough Council (the Council), which is open to applicants for social housing whom the Council has identified as having a priority need.\\nThe Council cannot compel the Housing Charity to take tenants who do not fall within scope of its charitable objective and its selection criteria.\\nThis, combined with a significant surplus of need for social housing on the part of the Orthodox Jewish community, means that in practice the Council only nominates and the Housing Charity only accepts members of that community for the Housing Charitys properties.\\nThe social housing provided by the Housing Charity makes up less than 1% of the social housing available in Hackney.\\nThe principal appellant (the appellant) is a single mother with four small children, two of whom have autism.\\nThe Council identified the appellant as having a priority need for social housing in a larger property, and she has now been housed by the Council in such a property.\\nHowever, she had to wait longer to be allocated suitable housing as she is not a member of the Orthodox Jewish community and so larger properties owned by the Housing Charity which became vacant were not available to her.\\nShe issued proceedings against the Council and the Housing Charity, alleging that she had thereby suffered unlawful direct discrimination on grounds of race or religion contrary to the Equality Act 2010.\\nThe Divisional Court dismissed the claim and the Court of Appeal dismissed her appeal.\\nThe appellant now appeals to this Court.\\nShe was given permission to add to her claim based on the Equality Act 2010 a new claim that the allocation policy of the Housing Charity contravened the Race Directive by unlawfully discriminating against her on the grounds of race or ethnic origin.\\nThe appeal turns on whether the Housing Charity acted unlawfully or not in restricting access to its stock of social housing.\\nThe Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.\\nLord Sales gives the main judgment (with which Lord Reed, Lord Kerr and Lord Kitchen agree).\\nLady Arden gives a concurring judgment.\\nEquality Act 2010 The Equality Act 2010 makes it unlawful to discriminate directly against any person on the basis of certain characteristics, known as protected characteristics.\\nThese include race and religion or belief [17] [18].\\nHowever, the Act sets out exemptions where certain actions will not be considered as unlawful direct discrimination.\\nSection 158 provides one such exemption where positive action addresses in a proportionate manner needs or disadvantages connected to a protected characteristic [19].\\nSection 193 sets out two further exemptions.\\nSection 193(2)(a) permits charities to restrict benefits to those with a protected characteristic if that restriction is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim and section 193(2)(b) permits charities to restrict benefits to those who share a protected characteristic if the restriction seeks to prevent or compensate for a disadvantage linked to the characteristic [21].\\nLord Sales upholds the lower courts findings that the Housing Charitys allocation policy is proportionate and lawful under sections 158 and 193(2)(a) of the Equality Act 2010.\\nA proportionality assessment first requires the identification of a legitimate aim and, secondly, consideration of whether the measures taken to promote that aim are proportionate, having regard to other interests at stake [65].\\nThe dispute in this case centres on what constitutes a legitimate aim [60] [72].\\nAs found by the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal, the legitimate aims here include the minimisation of disadvantages which are connected to the Haredi communitys religious identity and counteracting discrimination which they suffer, including in the private housing market, and the fulfilment of relevant needs which are particular to that community [66].\\nThe Housing Charity was entitled to adopt a clear and strict rule about who could and could not apply for its social housing, which meant that it was made available just for members of the Orthodox Jewish community, to ensure that its charitable activities were focused on that community, so that its activities did in fact fulfil its charitable objective to alleviate the problems of that community [76] [87].\\nLord Sales holds that the Divisional Court correctly considered the Housing Charitys allocation policy in the light of the applicable legal framework and, accordingly, was entitled to find it to be proportionate and lawful under these statutory exemptions.\\nLord Sales makes his own assessment of proportionality [76] [87], which is in agreement with that of the Divisional Court [73].\\nLord Sales holds that, in any event, the Court of Appeal was right to say that the Divisional Courts finding of proportionality could only be set aside if it had misdirected itself or reached a decision which was wrong.\\nApplying this approach, he holds that the Divisional Court had been entitled to make this finding, with the result that its decision should be upheld on appeal [74] [75].\\nIn her concurring judgment, Lady Arden emphasises that an appellate court should generally not make its own assessment of proportionality in such circumstances [120], and with this caveat she agrees with the judgment of Lord Sales [121].\\nAs regards the exemption in section 193(2)(b), the Court dismisses the argument for the appellants that the provision is subject to an implied proportionality requirement.\\nThere is no sound basis on which such a requirement could be read into the provision [97].\\nFirst, even on the assumption that the case is within the ambit of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the ECHR), on the right to respect for private and family life, so that Article 14 of the ECHR (non discrimination) is applicable, any proportionality requirement inherent in that provision is satisfied by the structure of section 193 itself; Parliament was entitled to create a clear rule applicable to charities in the interests of conserving their resources for use in fulfilling their charitable objectives, having regard, among other things, to the regulation of charities under the Charities Act 2011 to ensure they operate in the public interest and the wide margin of appreciation accorded to Parliament, as the body with democratic authority, in setting social and economic policy, including encouragement for giving to charity [97] [110].\\nSecondly, on the same assumption that the case falls within the ambit of Article 8 of the ECHR, even if the structure of section 193 itself did not satisfy any relevant proportionality standard, the drafting of the provision and the policy underlying it are so clear that it would not be possible to read into it an additional proportionality requirement [111] [115].\\nIn the circumstances, therefore, it is not necessary to resolve the question whether the case falls within the ambit of Article 8 of the ECHR and the Court prefers to leave that issue open [96, 116].\\nSection 193(2)(b) should be applied according to its express terms.\\nIt is common ground that, on this basis, the requirements of section 193(2)(b) are satisfied in this case [50].\\nEven if a proportionality\\nrequirement could be read into the provision, it follows from the decision regarding proportionality in relation to section 158 and section 193(2)(a) that it would have been satisfied [55, 88].\\nThe Race Directive The Race Directive provides that discrimination on grounds of race or ethnic origin must be unlawful,

(ii) the offence of attempting to communicate indecently with an older child, contrary to section 34 of the 2009 Act; and (iii) the offence of attempting to meet with a child for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity, contrary to section 1 of the Protection of Children and the Prevention of Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2005 (together, the charges).\\nThe appellant objected to the admissibility of the evidence sought to be relied upon by the respondent on the basis that it was obtained covertly without authorisation under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Scotland) Act 2000 and without authorisation or reasonable suspicion of criminality in violation of his rights under article 8.\\nThese objections were dismissed and the appellant was convicted of the charges.\\nThe appellant appealed against his conviction to the High Court of Justiciary, which refused the appeal and granted the appellant permission to appeal to the Supreme Court on two compatibility issues, which arise in criminal proceedings over whether a public authority has acted in a way that is unlawful under section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998.\\nThe Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal.\\nLord Sales gives the judgment, with which all members of the Court agree.\\nThe appellant appeals on two issues: (1) whether, in respect of the type of communications used by the appellant and the PH group, article 8 rights may be interfered with by their use as evidence in a public prosecution of the appellant for a relevant offence; and (2) the extent to which the obligation on the state, to provide adequate protection for article 8 rights, is incompatible with the use by a public prosecutor of material supplied by PH groups in investigating and prosecuting crime [11].\\nOn the first issue, the appellant submits that there was an interference with the appellants rights to respect for his private life and his correspondence under article 8(1), which required the respondent to show that such interference was justified under article 8(2) [26].\\nThe court holds that there was no interference with those rights at any stage because: (i) the nature of the communications rendered them incapable of being worthy of respect under article 8; and (ii) the appellant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the communications [29] [31].\\nIt is implicit in article 8(1) that the protected features of private life and correspondence must be capable of respect within the scheme of values the ECHR exists to protect and promote.\\nStates party to the ECHR have a special responsibility to protect children against sexual exploitation by adults [32] [33].\\nHere, in the absence of any state surveillance, and where the issue is the balance of the interests of a person engaging in such conduct and the children who are the recipients of the relevant communications, the reprehensible nature of the communications means they do not attract protection under article 8(1) [40].\\nThe interests of children have priority over any interest a paedophile could have in being allowed to engage in criminal conduct.\\nFurther, the prohibition of the abuse of rights in article 17 of the ECHR supports the conclusion that the criminal conduct at issue in this case is not capable of respect for the purposes of article 8(1) [41] [43].\\nAn important indication of whether the right to respect for private life and correspondence is engaged is whether the individual had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to those communications, which is an objective question [51] [55].\\nThe appellants communications were sent directly to the decoy.\\nThere was no prior relationship between the appellant and recipient from which an expectation of privacy might be said to arise.\\nRequests made by the appellant to the decoy to keep the communications private did not establish a relationship of confidentiality.\\nFurthermore, the appellant believed he was communicating with a 13 year old child, who it was foreseeable might share any worrying communications with an adult [56].\\nThe appellant may have enjoyed a reasonable expectation of privacy so far as the possibility of police surveillance or intrusion by the wider public are concerned, but not in relation to the recipient [58].\\nOnce the evidence had been passed on to the police, the appellant had no reasonable expectation that either the police or the respondent should treat them as confidential.\\nAgain, under the scheme of the ECHR, the effective prosecution of serious crimes committed in relation to children is part of the regime of deterrence a state must have in place [59].\\nOn the second issue, the state had no supervening positive obligation to protect the appellants interests that would prevent the respondent making use of the evidence to investigate or prosecute the crime.\\nOn the contrary, the relevant positive obligation on the respondent was to ensure that the criminal law could be applied effectively to deter sexual offences against children.\\nArticle 8 has the effect that the respondent should be entitled to, and might indeed be obliged to, make use of the evidence in bringing a prosecution against him [64].\\n\\nExplanation:\\n- general: general\\n- powers: power\\n- confidentiality: a non-lawyer\\n- authority: authority\\n- terms: term   \n",

that there was no express choice of law in this case and that the arbitration agreement was therefore governed by English law; and that it was appropriate to grant an anti suit injunction to restrain Chubb Russia from pursuing the Russian claim.\\nChubb Russia appeals to the Supreme Court.\\nBy a majority the Supreme Court dismisses the appeal.\\nThe judgment is given by Lord Hamblen and Lord Leggatt with whom Lord Kerr agrees.\\nLord Burrows delivers a dissenting judgment, with which Lord Sales agrees.\\nLord Sales also gives his own judgment.\\nWhere an English court must decide which system of law governs an arbitration agreement, it should apply the English common law rules for resolving conflicts of laws rather that the provisions of the Rome I Regulation, as the latter excludes arbitration agreements from its scope [25] [28].\\nAccording to the common law rules, the law applicable to the arbitration agreement will be: (i) the law expressly or impliedly chosen by the parties; or (ii) in the absence of such choice, the system of law most closely connected to the arbitration agreement [27].\\nIn determining whether the parties have made a choice of law, the court should construe the arbitration agreement and the contract containing it by applying rules of contractual interpretation of English law as the law of the forum [29] [34].\\nWhere the parties have not specified the law applicable to the arbitration agreement, but they have chosen the law to govern the contract containing the arbitration agreement, this choice will generally apply to the arbitration agreement [43] [52].\\nThis general rule encourages legal certainty, consistency and coherence while avoiding complexity and artificiality [53].\\nThe Court of Appeal was wrong to find that there is a strong presumption that the parties have, by implication, chosen the law of the seat of the arbitration to govern the arbitration agreement [59] [64].\\nAny overlap between the law of the seat and that of the arbitration does not justify such a presumption [64] [94].\\nWhile a choice of seat can lead to such an inference in some cases, the content of the Arbitration Act 1996, particularly section 4(5), does not support such a general inference [73] [82].\\nWhere there is no express choice of law to govern the contract, a choice of the seat of the arbitration does not by itself justify an inference that the contract (or the arbitration agreement) is intended to be governed by the law of the seat [110] [117].\\nWhere the parties have made no choice of law to govern the arbitration agreement, either specifically or by choosing the law which is to govern the contract as a whole, the court must determine the law with which the arbitration agreement is most closely connected.\\nIn general, the arbitration agreement will be most closely connected with the law of the seat of arbitration. [118] [119].\\nThis default rule is supported by the following considerations: (i) the seat is where the arbitration is to be performed (legally, if not physically) [121] [124]; (ii) this approach maintains consistency with international law and legislative policy [125] [141]; (iii) this rule is likely to uphold the reasonable expectations of contracting parties who specify a location for the arbitration without choosing the law to govern the contract [142] [143]; and (iv) this approach provides legal certainty, allowing parties to predict easily which law the court will apply in the absence of choice [144].\\nThe majority holds that the contract in this case contains no choice of the law that is intended to govern the contract or the arbitration agreement within it.\\nIn these circumstances the validity and scope of the arbitration agreement is governed by the law of the chosen seat of arbitration, as the law with which the dispute resolution clause is most closely connected [171].\\nThe seat of the arbitration is London.\\nTherefore, the majority upholds the Court of Appeals conclusion that English law governs the arbitration agreement, albeit for different reasons [171].\\nChubb Russia does not dispute that, if the arbitration agreement is governed by English law, it was legitimate for the Court of Appeal to grant an anti suit injunction in this case. [173].\\nThe Supreme Court, however, affirms the Court of Appeals decision that, in principle, it makes no difference whether the arbitration agreement is governed by English or foreign law, as the inquiry in both cases remains the same: whether there been a breach of the agreement and, if so, whether it is just and convenient to grant an injunction to restrain that breach [178] [182].\\nWhile there may be circumstances in which it would be appropriate to await a decision of a foreign court before granting an injunction, deference to foreign courts should generally give way to upholding the importance of the parties bargain [183].\\nLord Burrows and Lord Sales agree with the majority that, if the parties have expressly or impliedly chosen the law of the contract, this choice applies to the arbitration agreement [266].\\nThey dissent on what the default position should be in the absence of such choice.\\nThey consider that it should be that the law with which the main contract is most closely connected governs the arbitration agreement, as this is the law with which in their view the arbitration agreement is also most closely connected [257].\\nThey also dissent on whether the parties have in this case chosen the law that is to govern the contract.\\nIn their view, the parties impliedly chose Russian law to govern the construction contract and also,\\ntherefore, the arbitration agreement [228].\\nThey agree with the majority that whether it is appropriate to grant an anti suit injunction does not depend on what law governs the arbitration agreement but only on whether pursuing the foreign proceedings is a breach of that agreement.\\nAs they conclude that Russian law governs the arbitration agreement, they would remit the question of whether there has been a breach of the arbitration agreement so as to justify the grant of an anti suit injunction to the Commercial Court.\\n\\nExplanation:\\n- general: general\\n- authority: authority\\n- applicable laws: law\\n- terms: term\\n- jurisdictions: jurisdictions   \n",
